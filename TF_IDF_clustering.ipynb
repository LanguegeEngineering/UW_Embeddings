Lewandowski scored another qualifying goal against the same team on 1 April 2009, in a 10\\u20130 victory.Playing in Warsaw in the opening match of the UEFA Euro 2012 tournament against Greece, Lewandowski scored the first goal of the competition after an assist from then Dortmund teammate Jakub B\\u0142aszczykowski and was named Man of the Match. He played in all three games for Poland in the tournament, as the co-hosts crashed out of the group stage with two points earned.\\n\\n\\n=== 2013\\u20132017: Assuming the captaincy ===\\nLewandowski scored two penalties in the 5\\u20130 win against San Marino on 26 March 2013 during the 2014 World Cup qualifying campaign, his first match as captain. Later on in the campaign, on 6 September, he scored the equaliser against Montenegro in a 1\\u20131 home draw. Poland did not qualify for the 2014 World Cup in Brazil.On 7 September 2014, in Poland's first UEFA Euro 2016 qualifier, away against Gibraltar, Lewandowski scored his first international hat-trick, netting four goals in a 7\\u20130 win. On 13 June 2015, he scored another hat-trick in Poland's 4\\u20130 defeat of Georgia, with the three goals scored within the space of four minutes. On 8 October, he scored twice in a 2\\u20132 draw away to Scotland, opening and equalising with the last kick of the game to eliminate the hosts. Three days later he headed the winner in a 2\\u20131 victory against the Republic of Ireland, qualifying Poland for the tournament finals in France. Lewandowski ended the campaign with 13 goals, a joint European Championships qualifying record with David Healy's tally for Northern Ireland in UEFA Euro 2008 qualifying.At UEFA Euro 2016 in France, Lewandowski did not have a shot on target until the last-16 match against Switzerland in Saint-\\u00c9tienne. Following the 1\\u20131 draw, he scored his team's first attempt in the penalty shootout victory that sent them to the quarter-finals for the first time. In the 100th second of the quarter-final against Portugal at the Stade V\\u00e9lodrome, he finished Kamil Grosicki's cross to open another 1\\u20131 draw, and again scored in the shootout although the Poles lost. At the time of Poland's exit, Lewandowski had suffered more fouls than any other player in the tournament.\\n\\n\\n=== 2017\\u2013present: All-time Poland top scorer ===\\nOn 5 October 2017, Lewandowski scored a hat-trick in a 6\\u20131 win over Armenia to take his tally to 50 goals for Poland, surpassing the previous record of 48 goals set by W\\u0142odzimierz Luba\\u0144ski to become the all-time top scorer for Poland.

On 23 June, he scored a brace in a 2\\u20133 defeat against Sweden; however, Poland finished last in their group and were knocked out from the group stages.Lewandowski was selected for national squad ahead of the 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar. During the first game against Mexico, he missed a penalty; however, in the second match against Saudi Arabia, he scored his maiden goal at a FIFA World Cup as his Poland downed the first match giant killer Saudi Arabia 2\\u20130, ultimately played a key role in condemning Saudi Arabia and Mexico to elimination. He scored his second World Cup goal on a penalty in a 3\\u20131 loss to France in the round of 16.\\n\\n\\n== Style of play ==\\nLewandowski is widely regarded as one of the best strikers in the world, and is considered by many to be one of the greatest centre-forwards of all time. An accurate and efficient finisher with his head and both feet, Lewandowski is a prolific goalscorer, which has led him to be dubbed Lewangoalski. A well-rounded forward, he is said to possess almost all the necessary qualities of a traditional number nine: height, strength, balance, pace, intelligent movement and proficiency with both feet. Although he primarily operates as a goal-poacher in the penalty area, due to his positional sense, ability to shoot first time, strength in the air, and powerful shot with either foot, his excellent technical skills, quick feet, proficient dribbling, vision, and physique also enable him to hold up the ball with his back to goal and either bring his teammates into play, or win fouls for his team in useful positions; despite often functioning as a lone-centre forward or as an out-and-out striker.\\nHe has also stood out for his work-rate and defensive contribution off the ball, and is capable of dropping into deeper roles on the pitch, in order to create space for teammates with his movement, or surprise defenders by making late and sudden attacking runs into the area. Lewandowski is an accurate penalty taker and has repeatedly shown coolness and composure on the spot; he is also capable of scoring from long range, and has been known to take free kicks. In addition to his playing ability, Lewandowski has also been praised for his outstanding work-ethic, fitness, mentality, and discipline, both on the pitch and in training, by pundits, players and managers.\\n\\n\\n== Outside football ==\\n\\n\\n=== Personal life ===\\nLewandowski's father gave him the name Robert to make it easier for him when moving abroad as a professional footballer.

pronunciation: [ljo\\u02c8nel an\\u02c8d\\u027ees \\u02c8mesi] ; born 24 June 1987) is an Argentine professional footballer who plays as a forward for and captains both Major League Soccer club Inter Miami and the Argentina national team. Widely regarded as one of the greatest players of all time, Messi has won a record eight Ballon d'Or awards, a record six European Golden Shoes, and was named the world's best player for a record eight times by FIFA. Until leaving the club in 2021, he had spent his entire professional career with Barcelona, where he won a club-record 34 trophies, including ten La Liga titles, seven Copa del Rey titles, and the UEFA Champions League four times. With his country, he won the 2021 Copa Am\\u00e9rica and the 2022 FIFA World Cup. A prolific goalscorer and creative playmaker, Messi holds the records for most goals in La Liga (474), most hat-tricks in La Liga (36) and the UEFA Champions League (eight), and most assists in La Liga (192) and the Copa Am\\u00e9rica (17). He also has the most international goals by a South American male (106). Messi has scored over 800 senior career goals for club and country, and has the most goals by a player for a single club (672).\\nMessi relocated to Spain from Argentina aged 13 to join Barcelona, for whom he made his competitive debut aged 17 in October 2004. He established himself as an integral player for the club within the next three years, and in his first uninterrupted season in 2008\\u201309 he helped Barcelona achieve the first treble in Spanish football; that year, aged 22, Messi won his first Ballon d'Or. Three successful seasons followed, with Messi winning four consecutive Ballons d'Or, making him the first player to win the award four times. During the 2011\\u201312 season, he set the La Liga and European records for most goals scored in a single season, while establishing himself as Barcelona's all-time top scorer. The following two seasons, Messi finished second for the Ballon d'Or behind Cristiano Ronaldo (his perceived career rival), before regaining his best form during the 2014\\u201315 campaign, becoming the all-time top scorer in La Liga and leading Barcelona to a historic second treble, after which he was awarded a fifth Ballon d'Or in 2015. Messi assumed captaincy of Barcelona in 2018, and won a record sixth Ballon d'Or in 2019. Out of contract, he signed for French club Paris Saint-Germain in August 2021, spending two seasons at the club and winning Ligue 1 twice. Messi joined American club Inter Miami in July 2023, winning the Leagues Cup in August of that year.\\nAn Argentine international, Messi is the country's all-time leading goalscorer and also holds the national record for appearances. At youth level, he won the 2005 FIFA World Youth Championship, finishing the tournament with both the Golden Ball and Golden Shoe, and an Olympic gold medal at the 2008 Summer Olympics. His style of play as a diminutive, left-footed dribbler drew comparisons with his compatriot Diego Maradona, who described Messi as his successor. After his senior debut in August 2005, Messi became the youngest Argentine to play and score in a FIFA World Cup (2006), and reached the final of the 2007 Copa Am\\u00e9rica, where he was named young player of the tournament. As the squad's captain from August 2011, he led Argentina to three consecutive finals: the 2014 FIFA World Cup, for which he won the Golden Ball, the 2015 Copa Am\\u00e9rica, winning the Golden Ball, and the 2016 Copa Am\\u00e9rica. After announcing his international retirement in 2016, he reversed his decision and led his country to qualification for the 2018 FIFA World Cup, a third-place finish at the 2019 Copa Am\\u00e9rica, and victory in the 2021 Copa Am\\u00e9rica, while winning the Golden Ball and Golden Boot for the latter. That same year, Messi received a seventh Ballon d'Or. In 2022, he led Argentina to win the 2022 FIFA World Cup, where he won a record second Golden Ball, scored seven goals including two in the final, and broke the record for most games played at the World Cup (26), later receiving his record-extending eighth Ballon d'Or in 2023.\\nMessi has endorsed sportswear company Adidas since 2006. According to France Football, he was the world's highest-paid footballer for five years out of six between 2009 and 2014, and was ranked the world's highest-paid athlete by Forbes in 2019 and 2022. Messi was among Time's 100 most influential people in the world in 2011, 2012, and 2023. In 2020 and 2023, he was named the Laureus World Sportsman of the Year, with Messi being the first team-sport athlete to win the award. In 2020, Messi was named to the Ballon d'Or Dream Team and became the second footballer and second team-sport athlete to surpass $1 billion in career earnings.\\n\\n\\n== Early life ==\\nMessi was born on 24 June 1987 in Rosario, Santa Fe, the third of four children of Jorge Messi, a steel factory manager, and his wife Celia Cuccittini, who worked in a magnet manufacturing workshop. On his father's side, he is of Italian and Spanish descent, the great-grandson of immigrants from the north-central Adriatic Marche region of Italy, and on his mother's side, he has primarily Italian ancestry. Growing up in a tight-knit, football-loving family, \\\"Leo\\\" developed a passion for the sport from an early age, playing constantly with his older brothers, Rodrigo and Mat\\u00edas, and his cousins, Maximiliano and Emanuel Biancucchi, both of whom became professional footballers. At the age of four he joined local club Grandoli, where he was coached by his father, though his earliest influence as a player came from his maternal grandmother, Celia, who accompanied him to training and matches. He was greatly affected by her death, shortly before his eleventh birthday; since then, as a devout Roman Catholic, he has celebrated his goals by looking up and pointing to the sky in tribute to his grandmother.\\n\\nA lifelong supporter of Newell's Old Boys, Messi joined the Rosario club when he was six years old. During the six years he played for Newell's, he scored almost 500 goals as a member of \\\"The Machine of '87\\\", the near-unbeatable youth side named for the year of their birth, and regularly entertained crowds by performing ball tricks during half-time of the first team's home games. However, his future as a professional player was threatened when, aged 10, he was diagnosed with a growth hormone deficiency. As his father's health insurance covered only two years of growth hormone treatment, which cost at least $1,000 per month, Newell's agreed to contribute, but later reneged on their promise. He was scouted by Buenos Aires club River Plate, whose playmaker Pablo Aimar he idolised. It was speculated that he failed to be signed into River Plate due to his ill health, however in a 2019 interview, Messi revealed that the club had offered to pay for his medical treatment despite ultimately rejecting him. His goalscoring idol growing up was Brazilian striker Ronaldo, with Messi calling him \\\"the best forward I've ever seen\\\".\\nAs the Messi family had relatives in Catalonia, they sought to arrange a trial with Barcelona in September 2000. First team director Charly Rexach immediately wanted to sign him, but the board of directors hesitated; at the time it was highly unusual for European clubs to sign foreign players of such a young age. On 14 December, an ultimatum was issued for Barcelona to prove their commitment, and Rexach, with no other paper at hand, offered a contract on a paper napkin. In February 2001, the family relocated to Barcelona, where they moved into an apartment near the club's stadium, Camp Nou. During his first year in Spain, Messi rarely played with the Infantiles due to a transfer conflict with Newell's; as a foreigner, he could only be fielded in friendlies and the Catalan league. Without football, he struggled to integrate into the team; already reserved by nature, he was so quiet that his teammates initially believed he was mute. At home, he suffered from homesickness after his mother moved back to Rosario with his brothers and little sister, Mar\\u00eda Sol, while he stayed in Barcelona with his father.After a year at Barcelona's youth academy, La Masia, Messi was finally enrolled in the Royal Spanish Football Federation (RFEF) in February 2002. Now playing in all competitions, he befriended his teammates, among whom were Cesc F\\u00e0bregas and Gerard Piqu\\u00e9. After completing his growth hormone treatment aged 14, Messi became an integral part of the \\\"Baby Dream Team\\\", Barcelona's greatest-ever youth side. During his first full season (2002\\u201303), he was top scorer with 36 goals in 30 games for the Cadetes A, who won an unprecedented treble of the league and both the Spanish and Catalan cups. The Copa Catalunya final, a 4\\u20131 victory over Espanyol, became known in club lore as the partido de la m\\u00e1scara, the final of the mask. A week after suffering a broken cheekbone during a league match, Messi was allowed to start the game on the condition that he wear a plastic protector; soon hindered by the mask, he took it off and scored two goals in 10 minutes before his substitution. At the close of the season, he received an offer to join Arsenal, his first from a foreign club, but while F\\u00e0bregas and Piqu\\u00e9 soon left for England, he chose to remain in Barcelona.\\n\\n\\n== Club career ==\\n\\n\\n=== Barcelona ===\\n\\n\\n==== 2003\\u20132005: rise to the first team ====\\n\\nDuring the 2003\\u201304 season Messi rapidly progressed through the club's ranks, debuting for four youth teams in a single campaign. After being named player of the tournament in four international pre-season competitions with the Juveniles B, he was soon promoted to the Juveniles A, where he scored 18 goals in 11 league games. Messi was then one of several youth players called up to strengthen Frank Rijkaard's depleted first team during the international break. French winger Ludovic Giuly notes that Messi stood out in first team training sessions: \\\"He destroyed us all... Even the team's starting centre-backs were nervous. He was an alien.\\\"Messi made his first team debut as a 75th-minute substitute during a friendly against Porto on 16 November 2003. His performance, creating two chances and a shot on goal, impressed the technical staff, and he subsequently began training daily with the club's reserve side, Barcelona B, as well as weekly with the first team. Barcelona's new star player, Ronaldinho, believed the 16-year-old would become an even better player than himself; he soon befriended Messi, whom he called \\\"little brother\\\", and eased his transition into the first team.\\nTo gain further match experience, Messi played for Barcelona C, helping to save them from the relegation zone of the Tercera Divisi\\u00f3n by scoring five goals in ten games. He signed his first professional contract, which lasted until 2012 and contained an initial buyout clause of \\u20ac30 million, on 4 February 2004; this automatically increased to \\u20ac80 million when he made his debut for Barcelona B on 6 March. He played five games with the B team that season but did not score. Physically weaker than his opponents, who were often much older and taller, he worked on increasing his strength in order to be able to shake off defenders. He finished the campaign with a total of 36 goals in all official competitions.During the 2004\\u201305 season, Messi was a guaranteed starter for the B team, playing 17 games and scoring on six occasions. He was not called up to the first team until the senior players asked manager Frank Rijkaard to promote him in October 2004. Since Ronaldinho already played on the left wing, Rijkaard moved the initially-unwilling Messi onto the right, allowing him to cut into the centre of the pitch and shoot with his dominant left foot. He made his league debut as a late substitute against Espanyol on 16 October. At 17 years, three months, and 22 days old, he was at the time the youngest player to represent Barcelona in an official competition. As a substitute, he played 244 minutes in nine matches for the first team that season, including his debut in the Champions League against Shakhtar Donetsk. He scored his first senior goal on 1 May 2005 against Albacete, becoming \\u2013 at that time \\u2013 the youngest-ever scorer for the club. That season, Barcelona won the league for the first time in six years.\\n\\n\\n==== 2005\\u20132008: becoming a starting eleven player ====\\n\\nOn his 18th birthday, Messi signed his first senior contract, which increased his buyout clause to \\u20ac150 million and tied him to the club until 2010. On 24 August, during the Joan Gamper Trophy, he started for the first time and gave a well-received performance against Fabio Capello's Juventus, receiving an ovation from the Camp Nou. Capello sought to take Messi to Juventus on loan, but Inter Milan offered to pay his \\u20ac150 million buyout clause and triple his wages. Messi seriously considered the offer but ultimately decided to stay. On 16 September, his contract was extended to 2014.\\nDue to issues regarding his legal status, Messi missed the start of the 2005\\u201306 La Liga, but on 26 September, he acquired Spanish citizenship and became eligible to play. Wearing the number 19 shirt, he gradually established himself as the first-choice right winger, forming an attacking trio with Ronaldinho and striker Samuel Eto'o; he was in the starting line-up in major matches such as his first Cl\\u00e1sico against rivals Real Madrid on 19 November. Messi scored eight goals in twenty-five games, including, against Panathinaikos, his first in the Champions League, but suffered a torn hamstring against Chelsea on 7 March 2006. His participation in the Champions League final was ruled out on the day, and he was so disappointed that he refused to celebrate his team's victory over Arsenal in Paris.While Barcelona began a gradual decline, the 19-year-old Messi established himself as one of the best players in the world during the 2006\\u201307 campaign. Already an idol to the club's supporters, he scored 17 goals in 36 games across all competitions. However, he sustained a metatarsal fracture on 12 November and was injured for three months. He recovered in time for the Champions League last 16 round against Liverpool, but Barcelona lost and were knocked out. In the league, 11 of his 14 goals came from his last 13 games; on 10 March 2007, he became the first player in twelve years to score a hat-trick in a Cl\\u00e1sico, which ended in a 3\\u20133 draw. His growing importance to the club was reflected that month in a new contract which greatly increased his wages.\\nAlready frequently compared to compatriot Diego Maradona, Messi nearly replicated Maradona's two most famous goals in the span of seven weeks. During a Copa del Rey semi-final against Getafe on 18 April, he scored a goal remarkably similar to Maradona's Goal of the Century, by collecting the ball near the halfway line, running 60 metres (66 yd), and beating five defenders before scoring with an angled finish, just as Maradona had done; against Espanyol on 9 June, he scored with his hand in similar fashion to Maradona's Hand of God goal. Barcelona faltered that season, failing to reach the Copa del Rey final and losing the league to Real Madrid.After Ronaldinho lost form, Messi became Bar\\u00e7a's new star player at only 20 years old, receiving the nickname \\\"Messiah\\\" from the Spanish media. He was voted the third-best player of the year in the 2007 Ballon d'Or, behind Kak\\u00e1 and runner-up Cristiano Ronaldo, while international managers and national team captains voted him second for the FIFA World Player of the Year award, again behind Kak\\u00e1. Although he managed to score 16 goals during the 2007\\u201308 campaign, the second half of his season was again marred by injuries after he suffered a torn hamstring on 15 December. Returning against Celtic in the Champions League last 16 round, he reinjured himself during the return leg, which Rijkaard had selected him for against the medical staff's wishes; captain Carles Puyol criticised the Spanish media for pressuring Messi to play every match. Barcelona finished the season without trophies, eliminated in the Champions League by Manchester United, and placed third in the league.\\n\\n\\n==== 2008\\u201310: first treble and Ballon d'Or ====\\nAfter two unsuccessful seasons, Rijkaard and Ronaldinho departed from Barclona. In the latter's wake, Messi was given the number 10 shirt, and signed a new contract with an annual salary of \\u20ac7.8 million, becoming the club's highest-paid player. He and the club implemented strategies to combat his frequent muscular injuries, which ensured he would remain virtually injury-free during the next four years. His performances in 2008 saw him again voted runner-up for the Ballon d'Or and the FIFA World Player of the Year award, both times behind Cristiano Ronaldo.\\nIn his first uninterrupted campaign, the 2008\\u201309 season, he scored 38 goals in 51 games. Under Barcelona's new manager Pep Guardiola, Messi played mainly on the right wing as a false winger with the freedom to cut inside. During the Cl\\u00e1sico on 2 May 2009, he played for the first time as a false nine, positioned as a centre-forward but dropping deep into midfield to link up with Xavi and Andr\\u00e9s Iniesta. He set up his side's first goal and scored twice to end the match in an emphatic 6\\u20132 victory, the team's greatest-ever score at Real Madrid's Santiago Bernab\\u00e9u Stadium. He then scored once and assisted a second goal as Barcelona defeated Athletic Bilbao 4\\u20131 to win the Copa del Rey. With 23 league goals from Messi, Barcelona became La Liga champions. The season's Champions League top scorer with nine goals, the youngest in the tournament's history, Messi returned as a false nine for the final on 27 May against Manchester United, in which he scored once; Barcelona won 2\\u20130 and achieved the first treble by a Spanish team. On 18 September, he signed a new contract which increased his salary to \\u20ac12 million and committed Messi to the club through 2016 with a buyout clause of \\u20ac250 million.In the second half of 2009, Barcelona became the first club to achieve the sextuple, winning six top-tier trophies in a single year; after winning the Supercopa de Espa\\u00f1a and UEFA Super Cup in August, Messi scored the winning goal to claim the FIFA Club World Cup on 19 December. At 22 years old, Messi won both the Ballon d'Or and the FIFA World Player of the Year award by the biggest voting margin in each trophy's history. Unsatisfied with his position on the right wing \\u2013 with Zlatan Ibrahimovi\\u0107 now occupying the central forward role \\u2013 Messi resumed playing as a false nine in early 2010. He soon effectively became the tactical focal point of Guardiola's team, and his goalscoring rate increased.\\n\\nMessi scored a total of 47 goals in all competitions that season, equalling Ronaldo's club record from the 1996\\u201397 campaign. He became Barcelona's all-time Champions League top scorer by scoring all four of his side's goals in the quarter-final against Arsenal on 6 April. Although Barcelona were eliminated in the Champions League semi-finals by Inter Milan, Messi's eight goals meant he was the competition's top scorer for a consecutive year. As the league's top scorer with 34 goals (again tying Ronaldo's record), he helped Barcelona win a second consecutive La Liga trophy with only a single defeat and earned his first European Golden Shoe.\\n\\n\\n==== 2010\\u20132012: trophies and records ====\\nMessi secured Barcelona's first trophy of the 2010\\u201311 campaign, the Supercopa de Espa\\u00f1a, by scoring a hat-trick in his side's second-leg 4\\u20130 victory over Sevilla. He was again instrumental in a Cl\\u00e1sico on 29 November 2010 as Barcelona defeated their rivals 5\\u20130. Messi helped the team achieve 16 consecutive league victories, a record in Spanish football, concluding with another hat-trick against Atl\\u00e9tico Madrid on 5 February 2011. His club performances in 2010 earned him the inaugural FIFA Ballon d'Or, though his win was met with some criticism due to his lack of success with Argentina at the 2010 FIFA World Cup. Towards the end of the season, Messi played a prominent role in the Champions League semi-final victory against Real Madrid, scoring two goals, the second of which was highly acclaimed, in the first leg. Messi gave a man-of-the-match performance in the Champions League final against Manchester United on 28 May, scoring the match-winning goal of Bar\\u00e7a's 3\\u20131 victory, and becoming the competition's top scorer for the third consecutive year. Barcelona won a third consecutive La Liga title, with Messi scoring 31 and assisting 18 goals. He finished the season with 53 goals in all competitions, the highest in Spanish football history.\\nAs Messi developed into a combination of a creator and scorer, he scored an unprecedented 73 goals and provided 29 assists in all club competitions during the 2011\\u201312 season, producing a hat-trick or more on 10 occasions. He began the campaign by helping Barcelona win both the Spanish and European Super Cups, the first with a hat-trick. At the close of the year, on 18 December, he scored twice in the FIFA Club World Cup final, a 4\\u20130 victory over Santos. He again received the FIFA Ballon d'Or, becoming only the fourth player in history to win the Ballon d'Or three times. Additionally, he won the inaugural UEFA Best Player in Europe Award, a revival of the old-style Ballon d'Or. Messi was already widely considered one of the best footballers in history, alongside players like Diego Maradona and Pel\\u00e9.\\nOn 7 March 2012, Messi scored five times in a Champions League last 16-round match against Bayer Leverkusen, an unprecedented achievement in the UEFA Champions League era. Two weeks later, on 20 March, Messi became the top goalscorer in Barcelona's history at 24 years old, overtaking the 57-year record of C\\u00e9sar Rodr\\u00edguez's 232 goals with a hat-trick against Granada. Barcelona's era of greatness under Guardiola was however drawing to an end. Although Guardiola's Barcelona won their 14th trophy in the Copa del Rey against Athletic Bilbao, the team lost the league to Real Madrid and was eliminated in the Champions League semi-finals by Chelsea, with Messi missing a crucial penalty. In Barcelona's last home league match on 5 May, Messi scored all four goals before embracing Guardiola, who had announced his resignation as manager. He finished the season as league top scorer in Europe again, with a La Liga record of 50 goals, while his 73 goals in all competitions made him the single-season top scorer in European history.Under manager Tito Vilanova who had first coached him at La Masia, Messi became Barcelona's all-time top scorer in La Liga with 191 goals, and broke the record of most goals scored in a calendar year, previously set by Gerd M\\u00fcller in 1972. At the close of the year, Messi had scored a record 91 goals in all competitions for Barcelona and Argentina. Messi again won the FIFA Ballon d'Or, becoming the only player in history to win the Ballon d'Or four times.Barcelona had virtually secured their La Liga title by the start of 2013. However, their performances deteriorated in the second half of the 2012\\u201313 campaign, with Vilanova absent due to ill health. They were nearly eliminated in the Champions League first knockout round by AC Milan, but two goals and an assist from Messi secured a second-leg comeback. Messi signed a new contract on 7 February, committing himself to the club through 2018 with annual wages of \\u20ac13 million. He wore the captain's armband for the first time on 17 March, in a league match against Rayo Vallecano; the team's tactical focal point, more than 40% of Barcelona goals that season involved him, up from 24% three years earlier.\\n\\n\\n==== 2013\\u20132014: Messidependencia ====\\n\\nAfter four largely injury-free seasons, the muscular injuries that had previously plagued Messi reoccurred. After he suffered a hamstring strain on 2 April, during the first quarter-final against Paris Saint-Germain (PSG), his appearances became sporadic. In the second leg against PSG, with an underperforming Barcelona down a goal, Messi came off the bench in the second half and within nine minutes helped create their game-tying goal, which allowed them to progress to the semi-finals. Still unfit, he proved ineffective during the first leg against Bayern Munich and was unable to play at all during the second, as Barcelona were defeated 7\\u20130 on aggregate by the eventual champions. These matches gave credence to the notion of Messidependencia, Barcelona's perceived tactical and psychological dependence on their star player.\\nMessi continued to struggle with injury throughout 2013, eventually parting ways with his long-time personal physiotherapist. Further damage to his hamstring sustained on 12 May ended his goalscoring streak of 21 consecutive league games, a worldwide record; he had netted 33 goals during his run, including a four-goal display against Osasuna, while becoming the first player to score consecutively against all 19 opposition teams in La Liga. With 60 goals in all competitions, including 46 goals in La Liga, he finished the campaign as league top scorer in Spain and Europe for the second consecutive year, becoming the first player in history to win the European Golden Shoe three times. Following an irregular start to the new season under manager Gerardo Martino, formerly of his boyhood club Newell's Old Boys, Messi suffered his fifth injury of 2013 when he tore his hamstring on 10 November, leaving him sidelined for two months. Despite his injuries, he was voted runner-up for the FIFA Ballon d'Or, relinquishing the award after a four-year monopoly to Cristiano Ronaldo.During the second half of the 2013\\u201314 season, doubts persisted over Messi's form, leading to a perception among the cul\\u00e9s that he was reserving himself for the 2014 FIFA World Cup. Statistically, his contribution of goals, shots, and passes had dropped significantly compared to previous seasons. He still managed to break two longstanding records in a span of seven days: a hat-trick on 16 March against Osasuna saw him overtake Paulino Alc\\u00e1ntara's 369 goals to become Barcelona's top goalscorer in all competitions including friendlies, while another hat-trick against Real Madrid on 23 March made him the all-time top scorer in El Cl\\u00e1sico, ahead of the 18 goals scored by former Real Madrid player Alfredo Di St\\u00e9fano. Messi finished the campaign with his worst output in five seasons, though he still managed to score 41 goals in all competitions. For the first time in five years, Barcelona ended the season without a major trophy; they were defeated in the Copa del Rey final by Real Madrid and lost the league in the last game to Atl\\u00e9tico Madrid, causing Messi to be booed by sections of fans at the Camp Nou. After prolonged speculation over his future with the club, Messi signed a new contract on 19 May 2014, only a year after his last contractual update; his salary increased to \\u20ac20 million, or \\u20ac36 million before taxes, the highest wage in the sport. It was reported that Vilanova played a key role in convincing Messi to stay amid strong interest from Jos\\u00e9 Mourinho's Chelsea.\\n\\n\\n==== 2014\\u201315: second treble ====\\nUnder new manager and former captain Luis Enrique, Messi experienced a largely injury-free start to the 2014\\u201315 season, allowing him to break three more longstanding records towards the end of the year. A hat-trick scored against Sevilla on 22 November made him the all-time top scorer in La Liga, as he surpassed the 59-year record of 251 league goals held by Telmo Zarra. A third hat-trick, scored against city rivals Espanyol on 7 December, allowed him to surpass C\\u00e9sar Rodr\\u00edguez as the all-time top scorer in the Derbi barcelon\\u00ed with 12 goals. Messi again placed second in the FIFA Ballon d'Or behind Cristiano Ronaldo, largely owing to his second-place achievement with Argentina at the World Cup.At the start of 2015, Barcelona were perceived to be headed for another disappointing end to the season, with renewed speculation in the media that Messi was leaving the club. A turning point came on 11 January during a 3\\u20131 victory over Atl\\u00e9tico Madrid, the first time Bar\\u00e7a's attacking trident of Messi, Luis Su\\u00e1rez and Neymar, dubbed \\\"MSN\\\", each scored in a match, marking the beginning of a highly successful run. After five years of playing in the centre of the pitch, Messi had returned to his old position on the right wing late the previous year, by his own suggestion according to Su\\u00e1rez, their striker. From there, he regained his best form, while Su\\u00e1rez and Neymar ended the team's attacking dependency on their star player. With 58 goals from Messi, the trio scored a total of 122 goals in all competitions that season, a record in Spanish football.\\nTowards the end of the campaign, Messi scored in a 1\\u20130 away win over Atl\\u00e9tico Madrid on 17 May, securing the La Liga title. Among his 43 league goals that season was a hat-trick scored in 11 minutes against Rayo Vallecano on 8 March, the fastest of his senior career; it was his 32nd hat-trick overall for Barcelona, allowing him to overtake Telmo Zarra with the most hat-tricks in Spanish football. As the season's top assist provider with 18 he surpassed Lu\\u00eds Figo with the most assists in La Liga; he made his record 106th assist in a fixture against Levante on 15 February, in which he also scored a hat-trick. Messi scored twice as Barcelona defeated Athletic Bilbao 3\\u20131 in the Copa del Rey final on 30 May, achieving the sixth double in their history. His opening goal was hailed as one of the greatest in his career; he collected the ball near the halfway line and beat four opposing players, before feinting the goalkeeper to score in a tight space by the near post.In the Champions League, Messi scored twice and set up another in their 3\\u20130 semi-final victory over Bayern Munich, now under the stewardship of Guardiola. His second goal, which came only three minutes after his first, saw him chip the ball over goalkeeper Manuel Neuer after his dribble past J\\u00e9r\\u00f4me Boateng had made the defender drop to the ground; it went viral, becoming the year's most tweeted about sporting moment, and was named the best goal of the season by UEFA. Despite a second-leg loss, Barcelona progressed to the final on 6 June in Berlin, where they defeated Juventus 3\\u20131 to win their second treble, becoming the first team in history to do so. Although Messi did not score, he participated in each of his side's goals, particularly the second as he forced a parried save from goalkeeper Gianluigi Buffon from which Su\\u00e1rez scored the match-winning goal on the rebound. In addition to being the top assist provider with six assists, Messi finished the competition as the joint top scorer with ten goals, which earned him the distinction of being the first player ever to achieve the top scoring mark in five Champions League seasons. For his efforts during the season, he received the UEFA Best Player in Europe award for a second time.\\n\\n\\n==== 2015\\u201316: domestic success ====\\nMessi opened the 2015\\u201316 season by scoring twice from free kicks in Barcelona's 5\\u20134 victory (after extra time) over Sevilla in the UEFA Super Cup. On 16 September, he became the youngest player to make 100 appearances in the UEFA Champions League in a 1\\u20131 away draw to Roma. After a knee injury, he returned to the pitch on 21 November, making a substitute appearance in Barcelona's 4\\u20130 away win over rivals Real Madrid in El Cl\\u00e1sico. Messi capped off the year by winning the 2015 FIFA Club World Cup final on 20 December, collecting his fifth club trophy of 2015 as Barcelona defeated River Plate 3\\u20130 in Yokohama. On 30 December, Messi scored on his 500th appearance for Barcelona, in a 4\\u20130 home win over Real Betis.On 11 January 2016, Messi won the FIFA Ballon d'Or for a record fifth time in his career. On 3 February, he scored a hat-trick in Barcelona's 7\\u20130 win against Valencia in the first leg of the Copa del Rey semi-final at the Camp Nou. In a 6\\u20131 home win against Celta Vigo in the league, Messi assisted Su\\u00e1rez from a penalty kick. Some saw it as \\\"a touch of genius\\\", while others criticised it as being disrespectful to the opponent. The Celta players never complained and their coach defended the penalty, stating, \\\"Barca's forwards are very respectful.\\\" The penalty routine has been compared to that of Bar\\u00e7a icon Johan Cruyff in 1982, who was battling lung cancer, leading many fans to indicate that the penalty was a tribute to him. Cruyff himself was \\\"very happy\\\" with the play, insisting \\\"it was legal and entertaining\\\".On 17 February, Messi reached his 300th league goal in a 3\\u20131 away win against Sporting de Gij\\u00f3n. A few days later, he scored both goals in Barcelona's 2\\u20130 win against Arsenal at the Emirates Stadium, in the first leg of the 2015\\u201316 UEFA Champions League round of 16, with the second goal being Barcelona's 10,000th in official competitions. On 17 April, Messi ended a five-match scoring drought with his 500th senior career goal for club and country in Barcelona's 2\\u20131 home loss to Valencia. Messi finished the 2015\\u201316 season by setting up both goals in Barcelona's 2\\u20130 extra time win over Sevilla in the 2016 Copa del Rey final, at the Vicente Calder\\u00f3n Stadium, on 22 May 2016, as the club celebrated winning the domestic double for the second consecutive season. In total, Messi scored 41 goals as Barcelona's attacking trio managed a Spanish record of 131 goals throughout the season, breaking the record they had set the previous season.\\n\\n\\n==== 2016\\u201317: fourth Golden Boot ====\\n\\nMessi opened the 2016\\u201317 season by lifting the 2016 Supercopa de Espa\\u00f1a as Barcelona's captain in the absence of the injured Andr\\u00e9s Iniesta; he set-up Munir's goal in a 2\\u20130 away win over Sevilla in the first leg on 14 August, and subsequently scored in a 3\\u20130 win in the return leg on 17 August. Three days later, he scored two goals as Barcelona won 6\\u20132 against Real Betis in the opening game of the 2016\\u201317 La Liga season. On 13 September, Messi scored his first hat-trick of the season in the opening game of the 2016\\u201317 UEFA Champions League campaign against Celtic in a 7\\u20130 victory; this was also Messi's sixth hat-trick in the Champions League, the most by any player. A week later, Messi sustained a groin injury in a 1\\u20131 draw against Atl\\u00e9tico Madrid and was ruled out with injury for three weeks. He marked his return with a goal, scoring three minutes after coming off the bench in a 4\\u20130 home win over Deportivo de La Coru\\u00f1a, on 16 October. Three days after this, he netted his thirty-seventh club hat-trick as Barcelona defeated Manchester City 4\\u20130. On 1 November, Messi scored his 54th Champions League group stage goal in Barcelona's 3\\u20131 away loss to Manchester City, surpassing the previous record of 53 goals held by Ra\\u00fal.\\nMessi finished the year with 51 goals, making him Europe's top scorer, one ahead of Zlatan Ibrahimovi\\u0107. After placing second in the 2016 Ballon d'Or, on 9 January 2017 Messi also finished in second place \\u2013 behind Cristiano Ronaldo once again \\u2013 in the 2016 Best FIFA Men's Player Award. On 11 January, Messi scored from a free-kick in Barcelona's 3\\u20131 victory against Athletic Bilbao in the second leg of the round of 16 of the Copa del Rey, which enabled Barcelona to advance to the quarter-finals of the competition; with his 26th goal from a free-kick for Barcelona in all competitions, he equalled the club's all-time record, which had previously been set by Ronald Koeman. In his next league match, on 14 January, Messi scored in a 5\\u20130 win against Las Palmas; with this goal, he equalled Ra\\u00fal's record for the most teams scored against in La Liga (35).On 4 February 2017, Messi scored his 27th free-kick for Barcelona in a 3\\u20130 home win over Athletic Bilbao in the league, overtaking Koeman as the club's all-time top-scorer from free-kicks. On 23 April, Messi scored twice in a 3\\u20132 away win over Real Madrid. His game-winning goal in stoppage time was his 500th for Barcelona. His memorable celebration saw him taking off his Barcelona shirt and holding it up to incensed Real Madrid fans \\u2013 with his name and number facing the crowd. On 27 May, Messi scored a goal and set up another for Paco Alc\\u00e1cer in the 2017 Copa del Rey final, helping Barcelona to a 3\\u20131 victory over Alav\\u00e9s, and was named Man of the Match. In total, Messi finished the 2016\\u201317 season with 54 goals, while his 37 goals in La Liga saw him claim both the Pichichi and European Golden Boot Awards for the fourth time in his career.\\n\\n\\n==== 2017\\u201318: domestic double and a record fifth Golden Boot ====\\nMessi opened the 2017\\u201318 season by converting a penalty in Barcelona's 1\\u20133 first leg home defeat to Real Madrid in Supercopa de Espa\\u00f1a. Thereby, Messi also extended his El Cl\\u00e1sico goalscoring record with the goal being his 24th official and 25th overall.\\nOn 9 September, Messi scored his first hat-trick of the 2017\\u201318 league campaign, against Espanyol in Derbi barcelon\\u00ed, thus helping to secure a 5\\u20130 home victory for Blaugrana over local rivals. Messi netted twice against Gianluigi Buffon, on 12 September, as Bar\\u00e7a defeated the last season's Italian champions Juventus 3\\u20130 at home in the UEFA Champions League. On 19 September, Messi found the net four times in a 6\\u20131 trashing of Eibar at the Camp Nou in La Liga. Three weeks later, on 1 October, Messi surpassed his former teammate Carles Puyol to become the third highest appearance maker in the club's history, as he helped Bar\\u00e7a defeat Las Palmas 3\\u20130 by assisting Sergio Busquets' opener and later adding two himself in his 594th official game for the club; the league game was played behind closed doors at the Camp Nou due to violence in Catalonia relating to an ongoing independence referendum.On 18 October, in his 122nd European club appearance, Messi scored his 97th UEFA Champions League goal, and his 100th in all UEFA club competitions, in a 3\\u20131 home victory over Olympiacos.

However, Messi remained on the bench during the entire match and did not play due to a reported injury, which aroused the anger of the fans at the stadium, who chanted \\\"refund\\\" (Cantonese: \\u56de\\u6c34). Messi's personal social media accounts were flooded by comments of unsatisfied fans. Legislative Council Member Kenneth Fok issued a statement condemning the organizer Tatler and Inter Miami, believing that both of them were responsible, when the latter received sky-high remuneration, but made the fans leave disappointed and owed them  an apology. The Government of Hong Kong also expressed extreme disappointment at Messi's absence and stated that it was considering revoking the HK$16 million sponsorship funds. This incident was dubbed \\\"Messi Messy\\\" by CNN, and translated as \\\"Messi's Chaos\\\" by the Hong Kong media.

To further prevent Spain from taking him, the Argentine Football Association organised two under-20 friendlies in June 2004, against Paraguay and Uruguay, with the purpose of finalising his status as an Argentina player in FIFA. Five days after his 17th birthday, on 29 June, he made his debut for his country against Paraguay, scoring once and providing two assists in their 8\\u20130 victory. He was subsequently included in the squad for the South American Youth Championship, held in Colombia in February 2005. As he lacked the stamina of his teammates, the result of his former growth hormone deficiency, he was used as a substitute in six of the nine games. After being named man of the match against Venezuela, he scored the winning 2\\u20131 goal in the crucial last match against Brazil, thereby securing their third-place qualification for the FIFA World Youth Championship.Aware of his physical limitations, Messi employed a personal trainer to increase his muscle mass, returning to the squad in an improved condition in time for the World Youth Championship, hosted by the Netherlands in June. After he was left out of the starting line-up in their first match against the United States, a 1\\u20130 defeat, the squad's senior players asked manager Francisco Ferraro to let Messi start, as they considered him their best player. After helping the team defeat Egypt and Germany to progress past the group stage, Messi proved decisive in the knockout phase as he scored their equaliser against Colombia, provided a goal and an assist against title favourites Spain, and scored their opening goal against reigning champions Brazil. Ahead of the final, he was awarded the Golden Ball as the best player of the tournament. He scored two penalties in their 2\\u20131 victory over Nigeria, clinching Argentina's fifth championship and finishing the tournament as top scorer with 6 goals. His performances drew comparisons with compatriot Diego Maradona, who had led Argentina to the title in 1979.\\n\\n\\n=== 2005\\u20132006: senior and World Cup debuts ===\\nIn recognition of his achievements with the under-20 side, senior manager Jos\\u00e9 P\\u00e9kerman gave Messi his first call-up for a friendly against Hungary on 17 August 2005. Aged 18, Messi made his senior debut for Argentina in the Ferenc Pusk\\u00e1s Stadium when he came on in the 63rd minute, only to be sent off after two minutes for a perceived foul against Vilmos Vancz\\u00e1k, who had grabbed his shirt; Messi had struck the defender with his arm while trying to shake him off, which the referee interpreted as an intentional elbowing, a contentious decision. Messi was reportedly found weeping in the dressing room after his sending-off. He returned to the team on 3 September in their World Cup qualifier defeat to Paraguay, which he had declared his \\\"re-debut\\\" ahead of the match. Messi started his first game in the next qualifying match against Peru, in which he was able to win a crucial penalty that secured their victory. After the match, P\\u00e9kerman described him as \\\"a jewel\\\". He subsequently made regular appearances for the team ahead of Argentina's participation in the 2006 FIFA World Cup, scoring his first goal in a friendly against Croatia on 1 March 2006. A hamstring injury sustained a week later jeopardised his presence in the World Cup, but he was nevertheless selected for P\\u00e9kerman's squad and regained fitness in time for the start of the tournament.During the World Cup in Germany, Messi witnessed their opening match victory against the Ivory Coast from the substitutes' bench. In the next match, against Serbia and Montenegro, he became the youngest player to represent Argentina at a FIFA World Cup when he came on as a substitute in the 74th minute. He assisted their fourth strike within minutes and scored the final goal in their 6\\u20130 victory, making him the youngest scorer in the tournament and the sixth-youngest goalscorer in the history of the World Cup. As their progression to the knockout phase was secured, several starters were rested during the last group match. Messi consequently started the game against the Netherlands, a 0\\u20130 draw, as they won their group on goal differential. In the round of 16 match against Mexico, played on his 19th birthday, Messi came on in the 84th minute, with the score tied at 1\\u20131. He appeared to score a goal, but it was contentiously ruled offside, with the team needing a late goal in extra time to proceed. He did not play in the quarter-final against Germany, during which Argentina were eliminated 4\\u20132 in a penalty shootout. Back home, P\\u00e9kerman's decision to leave him on the bench against Germany led to widespread criticism from those who believed Messi could have changed the outcome of the match in Argentina's favour.\\n\\n\\n=== 2007\\u20132008: Copa Am\\u00e9rica final and Olympic gold ===\\nAs Messi evolved into one of the best players in the world, he secured a place in Alfio Basile's starting line-up, as part of a team considered favourites to win the 2007 Copa Am\\u00e9rica, held in Venezuela. He set up the game-winning goal of their 4\\u20131 victory over the United States in the opening match, before winning a penalty that led to the game-tying first strike of their 4\\u20132 win in the next match against Colombia. At the quarter-final stage, where the group winners faced Peru, he scored the second goal of a 4\\u20130 victory that saw them through to the semi-final, during which he chipped the ball over Mexico's goalkeeper to ensure another 3\\u20130 win. In a surprise defeat, Argentina lost the final 3\\u20130 to a Brazil squad that lacked several of the nation's best players. Their unexpected loss was followed by much criticism in Argentina, though Messi was mostly exempt due to his young age and secondary status to star player Juan Rom\\u00e1n Riquelme. He was named the best young player of the tournament by CONMEBOL.Ahead of the 2008 Summer Olympics, Barcelona legally barred Messi from representing Argentina at the tournament as it coincided with their Champions League qualifying matches. After interference from newly appointed Barcelona manager Pep Guardiola, who had won the tournament in 1992, Messi was permitted to join Sergio Batista's under-23 squad in Beijing. During the first match, he scored the opening goal in their 2\\u20131 victory over the Ivory Coast. Following a 1\\u20130 win in the next group match against Australia, ensuring their quarter-final qualification, Messi was rested during the game against Serbia, while his side won the match to finish first in their group. Against the Netherlands, he again scored the first goal and assisted a second strike to help his team to a 2\\u20131 win in extra time. After a 3\\u20130 semi-final victory over Brazil, Messi assisted the only goal in the final as Argentina defeated Nigeria to claim Olympic gold medals. Along with Riquelme, Messi was singled out by FIFA as the stand-out player from the tournament's best team.\\n\\n\\n=== 2008\\u20132011: collective decline ===\\nFrom late 2008, the national team experienced a three-year period marked by poor performances. Under manager Diego Maradona, who had led Argentina to World Cup victory as a player, the team struggled to qualify for the 2010 World Cup, securing their place in the tournament only after defeating Uruguay 1\\u20130 in their last qualifying match. Maradona was criticised for his strategic decisions, which included playing Messi out of his usual position. In eight qualifying matches under Maradona's stewardship, Messi scored only one goal, netting the opening goal in the first such match, a 4\\u20130 victory over Venezuela. During that game, played on 28 March 2009, he wore Argentina's number 10 shirt for the first time, following the international retirement of Riquelme. Overall, Messi scored four goals in 18 appearances during the qualifying process. Ahead of the tournament, Maradona visited Messi in Barcelona to request his tactical input; Messi then outlined a 4\\u20133\\u20131\\u20132 formation with himself playing behind the two strikers, a playmaking position known as the enganche in Argentine football, which had been his preferred position since childhood.\\nDespite their poor qualifying campaign, Argentina were considered title contenders at the World Cup in South Africa. At the start of the tournament, the new formation proved effective; Messi managed at least four attempts on goal during their opening match but was repeatedly denied by Nigeria's goalkeeper, resulting in a 1\\u20130 win. During the next match, against South Korea, he excelled in his playmaking role, participating in all four goals of his side's 4\\u20131 victory. As their place in the knockout phase was guaranteed, most of the starters were rested during the last group match, but Messi reportedly refused to be benched. He wore the captain's armband for the first time in their 2\\u20130 win against Greece; as the focal point of their play, he helped create their second goal to see Argentina finish as group winners.Argentina were eliminated in the quarter-final against Germany, at the same stage of the tournament and by the same opponent as four years earlier. Their 4\\u20130 loss was their worst margin of defeat at a World Cup since 1974. FIFA subsequently identified Messi as one of the tournament's 10 best players, citing his \\\"outstanding\\\" pace and creativity and \\\"spectacular and efficient\\\" dribbling, shooting and passing. Back home, however, Messi was the subject of harsher judgement. As the perceived best player in the world, he had been expected to lead an average team to the title, as Maradona arguably did in 1986, but he had failed to replicate his performances at Barcelona with the national team, leading to the accusation that he cared less about his country than his club.Maradona was replaced by Sergio Batista, who had orchestrated Argentina's Olympic victory. Batista publicly stated that he intended to build the team around Messi, employing him as a false nine within a 4\\u20133\\u20133 system, as used to much success by Barcelona. Although Messi scored a record 53 goals during the 2010\\u201311 club season, he had not scored for Argentina in an official match since March 2009. Despite the tactical change, his goal drought continued during the 2011 Copa Am\\u00e9rica, hosted by Argentina. Their first two matches, against Bolivia and Colombia, ended in draws. Media and fans noted that he did not combine well with striker Carlos Tevez, who enjoyed greater popularity among the Argentine public; Messi was consequently booed by his own team's supporters for the first time in his career. During the crucial next match, with Tevez on the bench, he gave a well-received performance, assisting two goals in their 3\\u20130 victory over Costa Rica. After the quarter-final against Uruguay ended in a 1\\u20131 draw following extra time, with Messi having assisted their equaliser, Argentina were eliminated 4\\u20135 in the penalty shootout by the eventual champions.\\n\\n\\n=== 2011\\u20132013: assuming the captaincy ===\\nAfter Argentina's unsuccessful performance in the Copa Am\\u00e9rica, Batista was replaced by Alejandro Sabella. Upon his appointment in August 2011, Sabella awarded the 24-year-old Messi the captaincy of the squad, in accord with then-captain Javier Mascherano. Reserved by nature, Messi went on to lead his squad by example as their best player, while Mascherano continued to fulfil the role of the team's on-field leader and motivator. In a further redesign of the team, Sabella dismissed Tevez and brought in players with whom Messi had won the World Youth Championship and Olympic Games. Now playing in a free role in an improving team, Messi ended his goal drought by scoring during their first World Cup qualifying match against Chile on 7 October, his first official goal for Argentina in two-and-a-half years.Under Sabella, Messi's goalscoring rate drastically increased; where he had scored only 17 goals in 61 matches under his previous managers, he scored 25 times in 32 appearances during the following three years. He netted a total of 12 goals in 9 games for Argentina in 2012, equalling the record held by Gabriel Batistuta for the most goals scored in a calendar year for their country. His first international hat-trick came in a friendly against Switzerland on 29 February 2012, followed by two more hat-tricks over the next year-and-a-half in friendlies against Brazil and Guatemala. Messi then helped the team secure their place in the 2014 World Cup with a 5\\u20132 victory over Paraguay on 10 September 2013 when he scored twice from penalty kicks, taking his international tally to 37 goals to become Argentina's second-highest goalscorer behind Batistuta. Overall, he had scored a total of 10 goals in 14 matches during the qualifying campaign. Concurrently with his bettered performances, his relationship with his compatriots improved, as he gradually began to be perceived more favourably in Argentina.\\n\\n\\n=== 2014\\u20132015: World Cup and Copa Am\\u00e9rica finals ===\\nAhead of the World Cup in Brazil, doubts persisted over Messi's form, as he finished an unsuccessful and injury-plagued season with Barcelona. At the start of the tournament, however, he gave strong performances, being elected man of the match in their first four matches. In his first World Cup match as captain, he led them to a 2\\u20131 victory over Bosnia and Herzegovina; he helped create Sead Kola\\u0161inac's own goal and scored their second strike after a dribble past three players, his first World Cup goal since his debut in the tournament eight years earlier. During the second match against Iran, he scored an injury-time goal from 25 yards out to end the game in a 1\\u20130 win, securing their qualification for the knockout phase. He scored twice in the last group match, a 3\\u20132 victory over Nigeria, his second goal coming from a free kick, as they finished first in their group. Messi assisted a late goal in extra time to ensure a 1\\u20130 win against Switzerland in the round of 16, and played in the 1\\u20130 quarter-final win against Belgium as Argentina progressed to the semi-final of the World Cup for the first time since 1990. Following a 0\\u20130 draw in extra time, they eliminated the Netherlands 4\\u20132 in a penalty shootout to reach the final, with Messi scoring his team's first penalty.\\nBilled as Messi versus Germany, the world's best player against the best team, the final was a repeat of the 1990 final featuring Diego Maradona. Within the first half-hour, Messi had started the play that led to a goal, but it was ruled offside. He missed several opportunities to open the scoring throughout the match, in particular at the start of the second half when his breakaway effort went wide of the far post. Substitute Mario G\\u00f6tze finally scored in the 113th minute, followed in the last minute of extra time by a free kick that Messi sent over the net, as Germany won the match 1\\u20130 to claim the World Cup. At the conclusion of the final, Messi was awarded the Golden Ball as the best player of the tournament. In addition to being the joint third-highest goalscorer, with four goals and an assist, he created the most chances, completed the most dribbling runs, made the most deliveries into the penalty area and produced the most throughballs in the competition. However, his selection drew criticism due to his lack of goals in the knockout round; FIFA President Sepp Blatter expressed his surprise, while Maradona suggested that Messi had undeservedly been chosen for marketing purposes.Another final appearance, the third of Messi's senior international career, followed in the 2015 Copa Am\\u00e9rica, held in Chile. Under the stewardship of former Barcelona manager Gerardo Martino, Argentina entered the tournament as title contenders due to their second-place achievement at the World Cup. During the opening match against Paraguay, they were ahead two goals by half-time but lost their lead to end the match in a 2\\u20132 draw; Messi had scored from a penalty kick, netting his only goal in the tournament. Following a 1\\u20130 win against defending champions Uruguay, Messi earned his 100th cap for his country in the final group match, a 1\\u20130 win over Jamaica, becoming only the fifth Argentine to achieve this milestone. In his 100 appearances, he had scored a total of 46 goals for Argentina, 22 of which came in official competitive matches.As Messi evolved from the team's symbolic captain into a genuine leader, he led Argentina to the knockout stage as group winners. In the quarter-final, they created numerous chances, including a rebound header by Messi, but were repeatedly denied by Colombia's goalkeeper, and ultimately ended the match scoreless, leading to a 5\\u20134 penalty shootout in their favour, with Messi netting his team's first spot kick. At the semi-final stage, Messi excelled as a playmaker as he provided three assists and helped create three more goals in his side's 6\\u20131 victory over Paraguay, receiving applause from the initially hostile crowd. Argentina started the final as the odds-on title favourites, but were defeated by Chile 4\\u20131 in a penalty shootout after a 0\\u20130 extra-time draw. Faced with aggression from opposing players, including taking a boot to the midriff, Messi played below his standards, though he was the only Argentine to successfully convert his penalty. At the close of the tournament, he was reportedly selected to receive the Most Valuable Player award but rejected the honour. As Argentina continued a trophy drought that began in 1993, the World Cup and Copa Am\\u00e9rica defeats again brought intense criticism for Messi from Argentine media and fans.\\n\\n\\n=== 2016\\u20132017: third Copa Am\\u00e9rica final, first retirement, and return ===\\nMessi's place in Argentina's Copa Am\\u00e9rica Centenario squad was initially put in jeopardy when he sustained a back injury in a 1\\u20130 friendly win over Honduras in a pre-Copa Am\\u00e9rica warm-up match on 27 May 2016. It was later reported that he had suffered a deep bruise in his lumbar region. He was later left on the bench in Argentina's 2\\u20131 opening win over defending champions Chile on 6 June due to concerns regarding his fitness. Although Messi was declared match-fit for his nation's second group match against Panama on 10 June, Martino left him on the bench once again; he replaced Augusto Fern\\u00e1ndez in the 61st minute and subsequently scored a hat-trick in 19 minutes, also starting the play which led to Sergio Ag\\u00fcero's goal, as the match ended in a 5\\u20130 victory, sealing Argentina's place in the quarter-finals of the competition; he was elected man of the match for his performance.\\n\\nOn 18 June, in the quarter-final of the Copa Am\\u00e9rica against Venezuela, Messi produced another man of the match performance, assisting two goals and scoring another in a 4\\u20131 victory, which enabled him to equal Gabriel Batistuta's national record of 54 goals in official international matches. This record was broken three days later when Messi scored a free kick in a 4\\u20130 semi-final win against hosts the United States; he also assisted two goals during the match as Argentina sealed a place in the final of the competition for a second consecutive year, and was named man of the match once again.During a repeat of the previous year's final on 26 June, Argentina once again lost to Chile on penalties after a 0\\u20130 deadlock, resulting in Messi's third consecutive defeat in a major tournament final with Argentina, and his fourth overall. After the match, Messi, who had missed his penalty in the shootout, announced his retirement from international football. He stated, \\\"I tried my hardest. The team has ended for me, a decision made.\\\" Chile coach Juan Antonio Pizzi said after the match, \\\"My generation can't compare him to Maradona that's for my generation, because of what Maradona did for Argentine football. But I think the best player ever played today here in the United States.\\\" Messi finished the tournament as the second highest scorer, behind Eduardo Vargas, with five goals, and was the highest assist provider with four assists, also winning more Man of the Match awards than any other player in the tournament (3); he was named to the team of the tournament for his performances, but missed out on the Golden Ball Award for best player, which went to Alexis S\\u00e1nchez.Following his announcement, a campaign began in Argentina for Messi to change his mind about retiring. He was greeted by fans with signs like \\\"Don't go, Leo\\\" when the team landed in Buenos Aires. President of Argentina Mauricio Macri urged Messi not to quit, stating, \\\"We are lucky, it is one of life's pleasures, it is a gift from God to have the best player in the world in a footballing country like ours... Lionel Messi is the greatest thing we have in Argentina and we must take care of him.\\\" Mayor of Buenos Aires Horacio Rodr\\u00edguez Larreta unveiled a statue of Messi in the capital to convince him to reconsider retirement. The campaign also continued in the streets and avenues of the Argentine capital, with about 50,000 supporters going to the Obelisco de Buenos Aires on 2 July, using the same slogan.\\n\\nJust a week after Messi announced his international retirement, Argentine newspaper La Naci\\u00f3n reported that he was reconsidering playing for Argentina at the 2018 FIFA World Cup qualifiers in September. On 12 August, it was confirmed that Messi had reversed his decision to retire from international football, and he was included in the squad for the national team's upcoming 2018 World Cup qualifiers. On 1 September, in his first game back, he scored in a 1\\u20130 home win over Uruguay in a 2018 World Cup qualifier.\\nOn 28 March 2017, Messi was suspended for four international games for insulting an assistant referee in a game against Chile on 23 March 2017. He was also fined CHF 10,000. On 5 May, Messi's four match ban as well as his 10,000 CHF fine was lifted by FIFA after Argentina Football Association appealed against his suspension, which meant he could now play Argentina's remaining World Cup Qualifiers. Argentina's place in the 2018 World Cup was in jeopardy going into their final qualifying match as they were sixth in their group, outside the five possible CONMEBOL World Cup qualifying spots, meaning they risked failing to qualify for the World Cup for the first time since 1970. On 10 October, Messi led his country to World Cup qualification in scoring a hat-trick as Argentina came from behind to defeat Ecuador 3\\u20131 away; Argentina had not defeated Ecuador in Quito since 2001. Messi's three goals saw him become the joint all-time leading scorer in CONMEBOL World Cup qualifiers with 21 goals, alongside Uruguay's Luis Su\\u00e1rez, overtaking the previous record which was held by compatriot Hern\\u00e1n Crespo.\\n\\n\\n=== 2018: World Cup ===\\n\\nFollowing on from their poor qualification campaign, expectations were not high going into the 2018 World Cup, with the team, without an injured Messi, losing 6\\u20131 to Spain in March 2018. Prior to Argentina's opener, there was speculation in the media over whether this would be Messi's final World Cup. In the team's opening group match against Iceland on 16 June, Messi missed a potential match-winning penalty in an eventual 1\\u20131 draw. In Argentina's second game on 21 June, the team lost 3\\u20130 to Croatia in a huge upset. Post-match the Argentina coach Jorge Sampaoli spoke of the lack of quality in the team surrounding Messi, saying \\\"we quite simply couldn't pass to him to help him generate the situations he is used to. We worked to give him the ball but the opponent also worked hard to prevent him from getting the ball. We lost that battle\\\". Croatia captain and midfielder Luka Modri\\u0107 also stated post match, \\\"Messi is an incredible player but he can't do everything alone.\\\"\\nIn Argentina's final group match against Nigeria at the Krestovsky Stadium, Saint Petersburg on 26 June, Messi scored the opening goal in an eventual 2\\u20131 victory, becoming the third Argentine after Diego Maradona and Gabriel Batistuta to score in three different World Cups; he also became the first player to score in the World Cup in his teens, twenties, and his thirties. A goal of the tournament contender, Messi received a long pass from midfield and controlled the ball on the run with two touches before striking it across goal into the net with his weaker right foot. He was awarded Man of the Match. Argentina progressed to the second round as group runners-up behind Croatia. In the round of 16 match against eventual champions France on 30 June, Messi set up Gabriel Mercado's and Sergio Ag\\u00fcero's goals in a 3\\u20134 defeat, which saw Argentina eliminated from the World Cup. With his two assists in his team's second round fixture, Messi became the first player to provide an assist in the last four World Cups, and also became the first player to provide two assists in a match for Argentina since Maradona had managed the same feat against South Korea in 1986.Following the tournament, Messi stated that he would not participate in Argentina's friendlies against Guatemala and Colombia in September, and commented that it would be unlikely that he would represent his nation for the remainder of the calendar year. Messi's absence from the national team and his continued failure to win a title with Argentina prompted speculation in the media that Messi might retire from international football once again. In March 2019, however, he was called up to the Argentina squad once again for the team's friendlies against Venezuela and Morocco later that month. A conversation with Lionel Scaloni and his idol Pablo Aimar made Messi reconsider his decision to retire. He made his international return on 22 March, in a 3\\u20131 friendly defeat to Venezuela, in Madrid.\\n\\n\\n=== 2019\\u20132020: Copa Am\\u00e9rica third-place and suspension ===\\nOn 21 May, Messi was included in Scaloni's final 23-man squad for the 2019 Copa Am\\u00e9rica. In Argentina's second group match on 19 June, Messi scored the equalising goal from the penalty spot in a 1\\u20131 draw against Paraguay. After coming under criticism in the media over his performance following Argentina's 2\\u20130 quarter-final victory over Venezuela on 28 June, Messi commented that it had not been his best Copa Am\\u00e9rica, while also criticising the poor quality of the pitches. Following Argentina's 2\\u20130 semi-final defeat to hosts Brazil on 2 July, Messi was critical of the refereeing, and alleged the competition was \\\"set up\\\" for Brazil to win.In the third-place match against Chile on 6 July, Messi set-up Ag\\u00fcero's opening goal from a free kick in an eventual 2\\u20131 win, to help Argentina win the bronze medal; however, he was sent off along with Gary Medel in the 37th minute of play, after being involved in an altercation with the Chilean defender. Following the match, Messi refused to collect his medal, and implied in a post-match interview that his comments following the semi-final led to his sending off. Messi later issued an apology for his comments, but was fined $1,500 and was handed a one-match ban by CONMEBOL, which ruled him out of Argentina's next World Cup qualifier. On 2 August, Messi was banned for three months from international football and was fined $50,000 by CONMEBOL for his comments against the referee's decisions; this ban meant he would miss Argentina's friendly matches against Chile, Mexico and Germany in September and October. On 15 November, Messi played in the 2019 Supercl\\u00e1sico de las Am\\u00e9ricas versus Brazil, scoring the winning goal by a rebound of his saved penalty. On 8 October 2020, Messi scored a penalty in a 1\\u20130 victory against Ecuador, giving Argentina a winning start to their 2022 World Cup qualifying campaign.\\n\\n\\n=== 2021\\u20132022: Copa Am\\u00e9rica and World Cup triumphs ===\\n\\nOn 14 June 2021, Messi scored from a free kick in a 1\\u20131 draw against Chile in Argentina's opening group match of the 2021 Copa Am\\u00e9rica in Brazil. On 21 June, Messi played in his 147th match as he equalled Javier Mascherano's record for most appearances for Argentina in a 1\\u20130 win over Paraguay in their third game of the tournament. A week later, he broke the record when he featured in a 4\\u20131 win against Bolivia in his team's final group match, assisting Papu G\\u00f3mez's opening goal and later scoring two. On 3 July, Messi assisted twice and scored from a free-kick in a 3\\u20130 win over Ecuador in the quarter-finals of the competition. On 6 July, in a 1\\u20131 draw in the semi-finals against Colombia, Messi made his 150th appearance for his country and registered his fifth assist of the tournament, a cut-back for Lautaro Mart\\u00ednez, matching his record of nine goal contributions in a single tournament from five years earlier; he later scored his spot kick in Argentina's eventual 3\\u20132 penalty shoot-out victory to progress to his fifth international final. On 10 July, Argentina defeated hosts and defending champions Brazil 1\\u20130 in the final, giving Messi his first major international title and Argentina's first since 1993, as well as his nation's joint record 15th Copa Am\\u00e9rica overall. Messi was directly involved in nine out of the 12 goals scored by Argentina, scoring four and assisting five; he was named the player of the tournament for his performances, an honour he shared with Neymar. He also finished as top scorer with four goals tied with Colombia's Luis D\\u00edaz, with the Golden Boot awarded to Messi as he had more assists.On 9 September, Messi scored a hat-trick in a 3\\u20130 home win over Bolivia in a 2022 World Cup qualifier which also moved him above Pel\\u00e9 as South America's top male international scorer with 79 goals. In the 2022 Finalissima, the third edition of the CONMEBOL\\u2013UEFA Cup of Champions, at Wembley on 2 June 2022, Messi assisted twice in a 3\\u20130 victory against Italy and was named player of the match, securing his second trophy for Argentina at the senior level. Messi then followed this on 6 June with all five Argentina goals in a 5\\u20130 victory in a friendly win over Estonia, overtaking Ferenc Pusk\\u00e1s among the all-time international men's top scorers.\\nAt the 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar, Messi scored a penalty in Argentina's opening game, a 2\\u20131 defeat to Saudi Arabia, before scoring with a low 20-yard strike in their next match against Mexico in which Argentina won 2\\u20130, also recording an assist on Enzo Fern\\u00e1ndez's goal. In the last 16 game against Australia, Messi scored the opening goal in Argentina's 2\\u20131 win in what was his 1,000th senior career appearance, and became the most-capped male South American (CONMEBOL member) footballer of all time, surpassing the previous record set by Ecuador's Iv\\u00e1n Hurtado, as well as surpassing and equalling several other FIFA World Cup and national team records. In the quarter-final against the Netherlands, Messi assisted Argentina's first goal for Nahuel Molina with a reverse pass and then scored a penalty as the game finished 2\\u20132 after extra time. Argentina won 4\\u20133 in the penalty shootout, with Messi scoring the first penalty. In the semi-final against Croatia, Messi made a record-equalling 25th World Cup finals appearance, drawing level with Germany's Lothar Matth\\u00e4us, and scored the opening goal with a penalty before he assisted Argentina's third goal scored by Juli\\u00e1n \\u00c1lvarez in a 3\\u20130 win; with his 11th World Cup goal, Messi overtook Batistuta to become Argentina's all-time top-scorer at the World Cup. Argentina advanced to the final against France, with Messi stating that it would be his final World Cup appearance.In the 2022 FIFA World Cup final on 18 December, Messi made his record 26th World Cup match appearance at Lusail Stadium. He scored Argentina's opening goal with a penalty, becoming in the process the first player since the last-16 round was introduced in 1986 to score a goal in every round of a single World Cup edition. After Argentina's eventual two-goal lead was erased by France forward Kylian Mbapp\\u00e9, who scored twice inside two minutes, Messi would score again in extra-time to restore Argentina's lead, before Mbapp\\u00e9 again drew France level. Tied 3\\u20133 after extra-time, the match went to a penalty shoot-out. Messi scored Argentina's first goal in the shoot-out, with Argentina eventually winning 4\\u20132, ending the nation's 36-year wait for the trophy. Messi received the Golden Ball for player of the tournament, becoming the first player to win it twice. He finished second in the Golden Boot race with seven goals in seven games, one behind Mbapp\\u00e9. With his appearance and two goals in the final, Messi overtook Mattha\\u00fcs as the player with most appearances at the World Cup (26), and Pel\\u00e9 as the player with most direct goal contributions at the World Cup (21 \\u2013 13 goals and 8 assists). The championship game was widely acclaimed as one of the best of all time, with media coverage heavily framing it as a duel between Messi and Mbapp\\u00e9. Following the game, Messi confirmed that he had no plans to retire from the national team, saying \\\"I want to continue playing as a champion\\\". In December 2023, a set of jerseys he had worn during the World Cup was sold at auction for 7.8 million dollars.\\n\\n\\n=== 2023\\u2013present: 100 international goals ===\\nIn March 2023, Messi made his return to Argentina as a world champion with two appearances in friendlies in his home country. He scored his 99th international goal with a free-kick in Argentina's 2\\u20130 win over Panama; this also marked his 800th senior career goal for club and country. In the following match against Cura\\u00e7ao, Messi scored a hat-trick, his ninth for Argentina, and recorded an assist in a 7\\u20130 win. The first of his three goals saw him reach 100 international goals, making Messi the third player in history to reach the milestone.\\n\\n\\n== Player profile ==\\n\\n\\n=== Style of play ===\\nDue to his short stature, Messi has a lower centre of gravity than taller players, which gives him greater agility, allowing him to change direction more quickly and evade opposing tackles; this has led the Spanish media to dub him La Pulga At\\u00f3mica (\\\"The Atomic Flea\\\"). Despite being physically unimposing, he possesses significant upper-body strength, which, combined with his low centre of gravity and resulting balance, aids him in withstanding physical challenges from opponents; he has consequently been noted for his lack of diving in a sport rife with playacting. His short, strong legs allow him to excel in short bursts of acceleration while his quick feet enable him to retain control of the ball when dribbling at speed. His former Barcelona manager Pep Guardiola once stated, \\\"Messi is the only player that runs faster with the ball than he does without it.\\\" Although he has improved his ability with his weaker foot since his mid-20s, Messi is predominantly a left-footed player; with the outside of his left foot, he usually begins dribbling runs, while he uses the inside of his foot to finish and provide passes and assists.A prolific goalscorer, Messi is known for his finishing, positioning, quick reactions, and ability to make attacking runs to beat the defensive line. He also functions in a playmaking role, courtesy of his vision and range of passing. He has often been described as a magician; a conjurer, creating goals and opportunities where seemingly none exist. Moreover, he is an accurate free kick and penalty kick taker. As of September 2023, Messi ranks 5th all time in goals scored from direct free kicks with 65, the most among active players. He also has a penchant for scoring from chips.\\nMessi's pace and technical ability enable him to undertake individual dribbling runs towards goal, in particular during counterattacks, usually starting from the halfway line or the right side of the pitch. Widely considered to be the best dribbler in the world, and one of the greatest dribblers of all time, with regard to this ability, his former Argentina manager Diego Maradona has said of him, \\\"The ball stays glued to his foot; I've seen great players in my career, but I've never seen anyone with Messi's ball control.\\\" Beyond his individual qualities, he is also a well-rounded, hard-working team player, known for his creative combinations, in particular with former Barcelona midfielders Xavi and Andr\\u00e9s Iniesta.Tactically, Messi plays in a free attacking role; a versatile player, he is capable of attacking on either wing or through the centre of the pitch. His favoured position in childhood was the playmaker behind two strikers, known as the enganche in Argentine football, but he began his career in Spain as a left-winger or left-sided forward. Upon his first-team debut, he was moved onto the right wing by manager Frank Rijkaard; from this position, he could more easily cut through the defence into the middle of the pitch and curl shots on goal with his left foot, rather than predominantly cross balls for teammates. Under Guardiola and subsequent managers, he most often played in a false nine role; positioned as a centre-forward or lone striker, he would roam the centre, often moving deep into midfield and drawing defenders with him, in order to create and exploit spaces for passes, other teammates' attacking runs off the ball, Messi's own dribbling runs, or combinations with Xavi and Iniesta. Under the stewardship of Luis Enrique, Messi initially returned to playing in the right-sided position that characterised much of his early career in the manager's 4\\u20133\\u20133 formation, while he was increasingly deployed in a deeper, free playmaking role in later seasons. Under manager Ernesto Valverde, Messi played in a variety of roles. While he occasionally continued to be deployed in a deeper role, from which he could make runs from behind into the box, or even on the right wing or as a false nine, he was also used in a more offensive, central role in a 4\\u20132\\u20133\\u20131, or as a second striker in a 4\\u20134\\u20132 formation, where he was once again given the licence to drop deep, link-up with midfielders, orchestrate his team's attacking plays, and create chances for his attacking partner Su\\u00e1rez.\\nAs his career advanced, and his tendency to dribble diminished slightly with age, Messi began to dictate play in deeper areas of the pitch and developed into one of the best passers and playmakers in football history. His work-rate off the ball and defensive responsibilities also decreased as his career progressed; by covering less ground on the pitch, and instead conserving his energy for short bursts of speed, he was able to improve his efficiency, movement, and positional play, and was also able to avoid muscular injuries, despite often playing a large number of matches throughout a particular season on a consistent basis. Indeed, while he was injury-prone in his early career, he was later able to improve his injury record by running less off the ball, and by adopting a stricter diet, training regime, and sleep schedule. With the Argentina national team, Messi has similarly played anywhere along the frontline; under various managers, he has been employed on the right wing, as a false nine, as an out-and-out striker, in a supporting role alongside another forward, or in a deeper, free creative role as a classic number 10 playmaker or attacking midfielder behind the strikers.\\n\\n\\n=== Reception and comparisons to Diego Maradona ===\\n\\nA prodigious talent as a teenager, Messi established himself among the world's best players before age 20. Diego Maradona considered the 18-year-old Messi the best player in the world alongside Ronaldinho, while the Brazilian himself, shortly after winning the 2005 Ballon d'Or, commented, \\\"I'm not even the best at Bar\\u00e7a\\\", in reference to his prot\\u00e9g\\u00e9. Four years later, after Messi had won his first Ballon d'Or by a record margin, the public debate regarding his qualities as a player moved beyond his status in contemporary football to the possibility that he was one of the greatest players in history. An early proponent was his then-manager Pep Guardiola, who, as early as August 2009, declared Messi to be the best player he had ever seen. In the following years, this opinion gained greater acceptance among pundits, managers, former and current players, and by the end of Bar\\u00e7a's second treble-winning season, the view of Messi as one of the greatest footballers of all time had become the apparent view among many fans and pundits in continental Europe. He initially received several dismissals by critics, based on the fact that he had not won an international trophy at senior level with Argentina, until he won his first at the 2021 Copa Am\\u00e9rica.\\n\\nThroughout his career, Messi has been compared with his late compatriot Diego Maradona, due to their similar playing styles as diminutive, left-footed dribblers. Initially, he was merely one of many young Argentine players, including his boyhood idol Pablo Aimar, to receive the \\\"New Maradona\\\" moniker, but as his career progressed, Messi proved his similarity beyond all previous contenders, establishing himself as the greatest player Argentina had produced since Maradona. Jorge Valdano, who won the 1986 World Cup alongside Maradona, said in October 2013, \\\"Messi is Maradona every day. For the last five years, Messi has been the Maradona of the World Cup in Mexico.\\\" C\\u00e9sar Menotti, who as manager orchestrated their 1978 World Cup victory, echoed this sentiment when he opined that Messi plays \\\"at the level of the best Maradona\\\". Other notable Argentines in the sport, such as Osvaldo Ardiles, Javier Zanetti, and Diego Simeone, have expressed their belief that Messi has overtaken Maradona as the best player in history.In Argentine society, prior to 2019, Messi was generally held in lesser esteem than Maradona, a consequence of not only his perceived uneven performances with the national team, but also of differences in class, personality, and background. Messi is in some ways the antithesis of his predecessor: where Maradona was an extroverted, controversial character who rose to greatness from the slums, Messi is reserved and unassuming, an unremarkable man outside of football. An enduring mark against him is the fact that, through no fault of his own, he never proved himself in the Argentine Primera Divisi\\u00f3n as an upcoming player, achieving stardom overseas from a young age, while his lack of outward passion for the Albiceleste shirt (until 2019 he did not sing the national anthem and is disinclined to emotional displays) have in the past led to the false perception that he felt Catalan rather than truly Argentine. Football journalist Tim Vickery states the view among Argentines is that Messi \\\"was always seen as more Catalan than one of them\\\". Despite having lived in Spain since age 13, Messi rejected the option of representing Spain internationally. He has said: \\\"Argentina is my country, my family, my way of expressing myself. I would change all my records to make the people in my country happy.\\\" Moreover, several pundits and footballing figures, including Maradona, questioned Messi's leadership with Argentina at times, despite his playing ability. Vickery states the perception of Messi among Argentines changed in 2019, with Messi making a conscious effort to become \\\"more one of the group, more Argentine\\\", with Vickery adding that following the World Cup victory in 2022 Messi would now be held in the same esteem by his compatriots as Maradona.\\n\\n\\n=== Comparisons with Cristiano Ronaldo ===\\n\\nAmong his contemporary peers, Messi is most often compared and contrasted with Portuguese forward Cristiano Ronaldo, as part of an ongoing rivalry that has been compared to past sports rivalries like the Muhammad Ali\\u2013Joe Frazier rivalry in boxing, the Roger Federer\\u2013Rafael Nadal rivalry in tennis, and the Prost\\u2013Senna rivalry from Formula One motor racing.Although Messi has at times denied any rivalry, they are widely believed to push one another in their aim to be the best player in the world. Since 2008, Messi has won eight Ballons d'Or to Ronaldo's five, seven FIFA World's Best Player awards to Ronaldo's five, and six European Golden Shoes to Ronaldo's four. Pundits and fans regularly argue the individual merits of both players. Beyond their playing styles, the debate also revolves around their differing physiques \\u2013 Ronaldo is 1.87 m (6 ft 1+1\\u20442 in) with a muscular build \\u2013 and contrasting public personalities with Ronaldo's self-confidence and theatrics a foil to Messi's humility. From 2009\\u201310 to 2017\\u201318, Messi faced Ronaldo at least twice every season in El Cl\\u00e1sico, which ranks among the world's most viewed annual sports events. Off the pitch, Ronaldo is his direct competitor in terms of salary, sponsorships, and social media fanbase.After Messi led Argentina to victory in the 2022 FIFA World Cup, a number of football critics, commentators, and players have opined that Messi has settled the debate between the two players.\\n\\n\\n== In popular culture ==\\nMessi was the world's highest-paid footballer for five years out of six between 2009 and 2014; he was the first player to exceed the \\u20ac40 million benchmark, with earnings of \\u20ac41 million in 2013, and the \\u20ac50\\u2013\\u20ac60 million points, with income of \\u20ac65 million in 2014. Messi was second on Forbes list of the world's highest-paid athletes, after Ronaldo, with income of $81 million from salary and endorsements in 2015\\u201316. In 2018 he was the first player to exceed the \\u20ac100m benchmark for a calendar year, with earnings of \\u20ac126m ($154m) in combined income from salaries, bonuses and endorsements. Forbes ranked him the world's highest-paid athlete in 2019. From 2008, he was Barcelona's highest-paid player, receiving a salary that increased incrementally from \\u20ac7.8 million to \\u20ac13 million over the next five years. Signing a new contract in 2017, he earned $667,000 per week in wages, and Barcelona paid him $60 million as a signing on bonus. His buyout clause was set at $835 million (\\u20ac700 million). In 2020, Messi became the second footballer, as well as the second athlete in a team sport, after Ronaldo, to surpass $1 billion in earnings during their careers.\\nIn addition to salary and bonuses, much of his income derives from endorsements; SportsPro has consequently cited him as one of the world's most marketable athletes every year since their research began in 2010. His main sponsor since 2006 is Adidas. As Barcelona's leading youth prospect, he was signed with Nike since age 14, but transferred to Adidas after they successfully challenged their rival's claim to his image rights in court. Messi established himself as their leading brand endorser; from 2008, he had a long-running signature collection of Adidas F50 boots, and in 2015, became the first footballer to receive his own sub-brand of Adidas boots, the Adidas Messi. Since 2017, he has worn the latest version of the Adidas Nemeziz. In 2015, a Barcelona jersey with Messi's name and number was the best-selling replica jersey worldwide. At the 2022 World Cup, Adidas sold out of Messi's Argentina No.10 jersey worldwide.\\nAs a commercial entity, Messi's brand has been based exclusively on his talents and achievements as a player, in contrast to arguably more glamorous players like Ronaldo and David Beckham. At the start of his career, he thus mainly held sponsorship contracts with companies that employ sports-oriented marketing, such as Adidas, Pepsi, and Konami. From 2010, concurrently with increased achievements as a player, his marketing appeal widened, leading to long-term endorsement deals with luxury brands Dolce & Gabbana and Audemars Piguet. Messi is a global brand ambassador for Gillette, Turkish Airlines, Ooredoo, and Tata Motors, among other companies. Messi was the face of Konami's video game series Pro Evolution Soccer, appearing on the covers of PES 2009, PES 2010, PES 2011 and PES 2020. He subsequently signed with rival company EA Sports to become the face of their series FIFA and appeared on consecutive covers from FIFA 13 to FIFA 16.Messi was among the Time 100, an annual list of the world's most influential people, in 2011, 2012 and 2023. His fanbase on Facebook is among the largest of public figures: within seven hours of its launch in April 2011, Messi's Facebook page had nearly seven million followers, and by July 2023 he had over 114 million followers, the second highest for a sportsperson after Cristiano Ronaldo. He has over 450 million Instagram followers, the second highest for an individual and sportsperson after Cristiano Ronaldo. His World Cup celebration post from 18 December 2022 is the most liked post on Instagram with over 70 million likes. According to a 2014 survey in 15 international markets, Messi was familiar to 87% of respondents around the world, of whom 78% perceived him favourably, making him the second-most recognised player globally, behind Ronaldo, and the most likable of all contemporary players. On his economic impact on the city in which he plays, Terry Gibson called him a \\\"tourist attraction\\\".\\nMadame Tussauds unveiled their first wax sculpture of Messi at Wembley Stadium in 2012. A gold replica of his left foot, weighing 25 kg (55 lb) and valued at $5.3 million, went on sale in Japan in 2013 to raise funds for victims of the 2011 T\\u014dhoku earthquake and tsunami. In 2013, a Turkish Airlines advertisement starring Messi, in which he engages in a selfie competition with Kobe Bryant, was the most-watched ad on YouTube in 2013, receiving 137 million views, and was voted the best advertisement of the 2005\\u201315 decade to commemorate YouTube's founding. World Press Photo selected \\\"The Final Game\\\", a photo of Messi facing the World Cup trophy after Argentina's final defeat to Germany, as the best sports image of 2014. Messi, a documentary by filmmaker \\u00c1lex de la Iglesia, premiered at the Venice Film Festival in August 2014.In June 2021, Messi signed a five-year deal to become an ambassador for the Hard Rock Cafe brand. He stated, \\\"sports and music are an integral part of my life. It is an honor to be the first athlete to partner with a brand who has a history of teaming with music legends.\\\" In May 2022, Messi was unveiled as Saudi Arabia's tourism ambassador. Due to Saudi Arabia's poor human rights record, Messi was condemned the role which was viewed as an attempt of Saudi sportswashing. In April 2023, Messi was featured in the 200 year old Thrissur Pooram festival in Kerala, India. During Thrissur Pooram, which is one of the largest festivals in Asia, umbrellas carrying the illuminated cut outs of Messi holding the World Cup trophy were displayed on the top of caparisoned elephants during the Kudamattam ceremony.\\n\\n\\n== Personal life ==\\n\\n\\n=== Family and relationships ===\\nSince 2008, Messi has been in a relationship with Antonela Roccuzzo, a fellow native of Rosario. He has known Roccuzzo since he was five years old, as she is the cousin of his childhood best friend, Lucas Scaglia, who is also a football player. After keeping their relationship private for a year, Messi first confirmed their romance in an interview in January 2009, before going public a month later during a carnival in Sitges after the Barcelona\\u2013Espanyol derby.\\n\\nMessi and Roccuzzo have three sons. To celebrate his partner's first pregnancy, Messi placed the ball under his shirt after scoring in Argentina's 4\\u20130 win against Ecuador on 2 June 2012, before confirming the pregnancy in an interview two weeks later. Thiago was born in Barcelona on 2 November 2012. In April 2015, Messi confirmed that they were expecting another child. On 30 June 2017, he married Roccuzzo at a luxury hotel named Hotel City Center in Rosario. In October 2017, his wife announced they were expecting their third child. Messi and his family are Catholic Christians.Messi enjoys a close relationship with his immediate family members, particularly his mother, Celia, whose face he has tattooed on his left shoulder. His professional affairs are largely run as a family business: his father, Jorge, has been his agent since he was 14, and his oldest brother, Rodrigo, handles his daily schedule and publicity. His mother and other brother, Mat\\u00edas, manage his charitable organization, the Leo Messi Foundation, and take care of personal and professional matters in Rosario.Since leaving for Spain aged 13, Messi has maintained close ties to his hometown of Rosario, even preserving his distinct Rosarino accent. He has kept ownership of his family's old house, although it has long stood empty; he maintains a penthouse apartment in an exclusive residential building for his mother, as well as a family compound just outside the city. Once when he was in training with the national team in Buenos Aires, he made a three-hour trip by car to Rosario immediately after practice to have dinner with his family, spent the night with them, and returned to Buenos Aires the next day in time for practice. Messi keeps in daily contact via phone and text with a small group of confidants in Rosario, most of whom were fellow members of \\\"The Machine of '87\\\" at Newell's Old Boys. While at Barcelona he lived in Castelldefels, a village near Barcelona. He was on bad terms with the club after his transfer to Barcelona, but by 2012 their public feud had ended, with Newell's embracing their ties with Messi, even issuing a club membership card to his newborn son. Messi has long planned to return to Rosario to end his playing career at Newell's. Messi holds triple citizenship, as he is a citizen of Argentina, Italy, and Spain.\\n\\n\\n=== Philanthropy ===\\nThroughout his career, Messi has been involved in charitable efforts aimed at vulnerable children, a commitment that stems in part from the medical difficulties he faced in his own childhood. Since 2004, he has contributed his time and finances to the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), an organisation with which Barcelona also have a strong association. Messi has served as a UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador since his appointment in March 2010, completing his first field mission for the organisation four months later as he travelled to Haiti to bring public awareness to the plight of the country's children in the wake of the 2010 Haiti earthquake. He has since participated in UNICEF campaigns targeting HIV prevention, education, and the social inclusion of disabled children. To celebrate his son's first birthday, in November 2013, Messi and Thiago were part of a publicity campaign to raise awareness of mortality rates among disadvantaged children.\\nIn addition to his work with UNICEF, Messi founded his own charitable organisation, the Leo Messi Foundation, which supports access to health care, education, and sport for children. It was established in 2007 following a visit Messi paid to a hospital for terminally ill children in Boston, an experience that resonated with him to the point that he decided to reinvest part of his earnings into society. Through his foundation, Messi has awarded research grants, financed medical training, and invested in the development of medical centres and projects in Argentina, Spain, and elsewhere in the world. In addition to his own fundraising activities, such as his global \\\"Messi and Friends\\\" football matches, his foundation receives financial support from various companies to which he has assigned his name in endorsement agreements, with Adidas as their main sponsor.Messi has also invested in youth football in Argentina: he financially supports Sarmiento, a football club based in the Rosario neighbourhood where he was born, committing in 2013 to the refurbishment of their facilities and the installation of all-weather pitches, and funds the management of several youth players at Newell's Old Boys and rival club Rosario Central, as well as at River Plate and Boca Juniors in Buenos Aires. At Newell's Old Boys, his boyhood club, he funded the 2012 construction of a new gymnasium and a dormitory inside the club's stadium for their youth academy. His former youth coach at Newell's, Ernesto Vecchio, is employed by the Leo Messi Foundation as a talent scout for young players. On 7 June 2016, Messi won a libel case against La Raz\\u00f3n newspaper and was awarded \\u20ac65,000 in damages, which he donated to the charity M\\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\\u00e8res. Messi made a donation worth \\u20ac1 million ($1.1 million) to fight the spread of coronavirus. This was split between Clinic Barcelona hospital in Barcelona, Spain and his native Argentina. In addition to this, Messi along with his fellow FC Barcelona teammates announced he will be taking a 70% cut in salaries during the 2020 coronavirus emergency, and contribute further to the club to provide fully to salaries of all the clubs employees.In November 2016, with the Argentine Football Association being run by a FIFA committee for emergency due to an economic crisis, it was reported that three of the national team's security staff told Messi that they had not received their salaries for six months. He stepped in and paid the salaries of the three members. In February 2021, Messi donated to the Museu Nacional d'Art de Catalunya his Adidas shoes which he wore when he scored his 644th goal for Barcelona and broke Pel\\u00e9's record for most goals scored for a single club; the shoes were later auctioned off in April by the museum for charity to help children with cancer and were sold for \\u00a3125,000.In advance of the 2021 Copa Am\\u00e9rica in Uruguay, Messi donated three signed shirts to the Chinese pharmaceutical firm Sinovac Biotech\\u2014whose directors spoke of their admiration for Messi\\u2014in order to secure 50,000 doses of Sinovac's COVID-19 vaccine, CoronaVac, in the hope of vaccinating all of South America's football players. A deal brokered by Uruguay's president Luis Lacalle Pou, the plan to prioritise football players caused some controversy given widespread vaccine scarcity in the region, with the Mayor of Canelones Yamand\\u00fa Orsi remarking that \\\"Just as the president manifested cooperation with CONMEBOL to vaccinate for the Copa Am\\u00e9rica, he could just as well have the same consideration for Canelones\\\".\\n\\n\\n=== Tax fraud ===\\nMessi's financial affairs came under investigation in 2013 for suspected tax evasion. Offshore companies in tax havens Uruguay and Belize were used to evade \\u20ac4.1 million in taxes related to sponsorship earnings between 2007 and 2009. An unrelated shell company in Panama set up in 2012 was subsequently identified as belonging to the Messis in the Panama Papers data leak. Messi, who pleaded ignorance of the alleged scheme, voluntarily paid arrears of \\u20ac5.1 million in August 2013. On 6 July 2016, Messi and his father were both found guilty of tax fraud and were handed suspended 21-month prison sentences and respectively ordered to pay \\u20ac1.7 million and \\u20ac1.4 million in fines. Facing the judge, he said, \\\"I just played football. I signed the contracts because I trusted my dad and the lawyers and we had decided that they would take charge of those things.\\\"\\n\\n\\n== Career statistics ==\\n\\n\\n=== Club ===\\nAs of match played 14 March 2024\\n\\n\\n=== International ===\\n\\nAs of match played 22 November 2023\\n\\n\\n== Honours ==\\n\\nBarcelona\\nLa Liga: 2004\\u201305, 2005\\u201306, 2008\\u201309, 2009\\u201310, 2010\\u201311, 2012\\u201313, 2014\\u201315, 2015\\u201316, 2017\\u201318, 2018\\u201319\\nCopa del Rey: 2008\\u201309, 2011\\u201312, 2014\\u201315, 2015\\u201316, 2016\\u201317, 2017\\u201318, 2020\\u201321\\nSupercopa de Espa\\u00f1a: 2006, 2009, 2010, 2011, 2013, 2016, 2018\\nUEFA Champions League: 2005\\u201306, 2008\\u201309, 2010\\u201311, 2014\\u201315\\nUEFA Super Cup: 2009, 2011, 2015\\nFIFA Club World Cup: 2009, 2011, 2015Paris Saint-Germain\\nLigue 1: 2021\\u201322, 2022\\u201323\\nTroph\\u00e9e des Champions: 2022Inter Miami\\n\\nLeagues Cup: 2023Argentina U20\\n\\nFIFA World Youth Championship: 2005Argentina U23\\n\\nOlympic Gold Medal: 2008Argentina\\n\\nFIFA World Cup: 2022\\nCopa Am\\u00e9rica: 2021\\nCONMEBOL\\u2013UEFA Cup of Champions: 2022Individual\\n\\nBallon d'Or/FIFA Ballon d'Or: 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2015, 2019, 2021, 2023\\nFIFA World Player of the Year: 2009\\nThe Best FIFA Men's Player: 2019, 2022, 2023\\nEuropean Golden Shoe: 2009\\u201310, 2011\\u201312, 2012\\u201313, 2016\\u201317, 2017\\u201318, 2018\\u201319\\nFIFA World Cup Golden Ball: 2014, 2022\\nFIFA World Cup Silver Boot: 2022\\nFIFA Club World Cup Golden Ball: 2009, 2011\\nFIFA U-20 World Cup Golden Ball: 2005\\nFIFA U-20 World Cup Golden Boot: 2005\\nUEFA Club Footballer of the Year: 2008\\u201309\\nUEFA Men's Player of the Year Award: 2010\\u201311, 2014\\u201315\\nUEFA Champions League top scorer: 2008\\u201309, 2009\\u201310, 2010\\u201311, 2011\\u201312, 2014\\u201315, 2018\\u201319\\nCopa Am\\u00e9rica Best Player: 2015, 2021\\nCopa Am\\u00e9rica Top Goalscorer: 2021\\nLa Liga Best Player: 2008\\u201309, 2009\\u201310, 2010\\u201311, 2011\\u201312, 2012\\u201313, 2014\\u201315\\nPichichi Trophy: 2009\\u221210, 2011\\u201312, 2012\\u221213, 2016\\u201317, 2017\\u221218, 2018\\u201319, 2019\\u201320, 2020\\u201321\\nLaureus World Sportsman of the Year: 2020, 2023\\nBallon d'Or Dream Team: 2020\\nFIFA FIFPRO World 11: 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023\\nArgentine Sportsperson of the Year: 2011, 2021, 2022, 2023\\nArgentine Footballer of the Year: 2005, 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2015, 2016, 2017, 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023\\n\\n\\n== See also ==\\n\\n\\n== Notes ==\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n\\nBibliography\\n\\n\\n== External links ==\\n\\nOfficial website \\nProfile at Inter Miami\\nProfile at PSG\\nProfile at FC Barcelona\\nProfile at La Liga\\nProfile at Ligue 1\\nProfile at MLS\\nLionel Messi at BDFutbol \\nLionel Messi at Soccerbase \\nLionel Messi at Soccerway \\nLionel Messi at National-Football-Teams.com \\nLionel Messi \\u2013 FIFA competition record (archived) \\nLionel Messi \\u2013 UEFA competition record (archive)\",\n          \"Cristiano Ronaldo dos Santos Aveiro  (Portuguese pronunciation: [k\\u027ei\\u0283\\u02c8tj\\u0250nu \\u0281\\u0254\\u02c8naldu]; born 5 February 1985) is a Portuguese professional footballer who plays as a forward for and captains both Saudi Pro League club Al Nassr and the Portugal national team. Widely regarded as one of the greatest players of all time, Ronaldo has won five Ballon d'Or awards, a record three UEFA Men's Player of the Year Awards, and four European Golden Shoes, the most by a European player. He has won 33 trophies in his career, including seven league titles, five UEFA Champions Leagues, the UEFA European Championship and the UEFA Nations League. Ronaldo holds the records for most appearances (183), goals (140) and assists (42) in the Champions League, goals in the European Championship (14), international goals (128) and international appearances (205). He is one of the few players to have made over 1,200 professional career appearances, the most by an outfield player, and has scored over 850 official senior career goals for club and country, making him the top goalscorer of all time.\\nRonaldo began his senior career with Sporting CP, before signing with Manchester United in 2003, winning the FA Cup in his first season. He would also go on to win three consecutive Premier League titles, the Champions League and the FIFA Club World Cup; at age 23, he won his first Ballon d'Or. Ronaldo was the subject of the then-most expensive association football transfer when he signed for Real Madrid in 2009 in a transfer worth \\u20ac94 million (\\u00a380 million). He became a key contributor and formed an attacking trio with Karim Benzema and Gareth Bale which was integral to the team winning four Champions Leagues from 2014 to 2018, including La D\\u00e9cima. During this period, he won back-to-back Ballons d'Or in 2013 and 2014, and again in 2016 and 2017, and was runner-up three times behind Lionel Messi, his perceived career rival. He also became the club's all-time top goalscorer and the all-time top scorer in the Champions League, and finished as the competition's top scorer for six consecutive seasons between 2012 and 2018. With Real, Ronaldo won four Champions Leagues, two La Liga titles, two Copas del Rey, two UEFA Super Cups and three Club World Cups. In 2018, he signed for Juventus in a transfer worth an initial \\u20ac100 million (\\u00a388 million), the most expensive transfer for an Italian club and for a player over 30 years old. He won two Serie A titles, two Supercoppa Italiana trophies and a Coppa Italia, became the inaugural Serie A Most Valuable Player and became the first footballer to finish as top scorer in the English, Spanish and Italian leagues. He returned to Manchester United in 2021, finishing his only full season as the club's top scorer, before his contract was terminated in 2022. In 2023, he signed for Al Nassr.\\nRonaldo made his international debut for Portugal in 2003 at the age of 18 and has since earned more than 200 caps, making him both the country and history's most-capped player of all time, recognised by the Guinness World Records. With more than 100 goals at international level, he is also the sports all-time top goalscorer. Ronaldo has played in and scored at eleven major tournaments; he scored his first international goal at Euro 2004, where he helped Portugal reach the final. He assumed captaincy of the national team in July 2008. In 2015, Ronaldo was named the best Portuguese player of all time by the Portuguese Football Federation. The following year, he led Portugal to their first major tournament title at Euro 2016, and received the Silver Boot as the second-highest goalscorer of the tournament. This achievement would see him receive his fourth Ballon d'Or. He also led them to victory in the inaugural UEFA Nations League in 2019, receiving the top scorer award in the finals, and later received the Golden Boot as top scorer of Euro 2020.\\nOne of the world's most marketable and famous athletes, Ronaldo was ranked the world's highest-paid athlete by Forbes in 2016, 2017, and 2023, and the world's most famous athlete by ESPN from 2016 to 2019. Time included him on their list of the 100 most influential people in the world in 2014. He is the first footballer and the third sportsman to earn US$1 billion in his career.\\n\\n\\n== Early life ==\\nCristiano Ronaldo dos Santos Aveiro was born on 5 February 1985 in the S\\u00e3o Pedro parish of Funchal, the capital of the Portuguese island of Madeira, and grew up in the nearby parish of Santo Ant\\u00f3nio. He is the fourth and youngest child of Maria Dolores dos Santos Viveiros da Aveiro, who worked as a cook in the hospitality industry and a cleaning woman, and Jos\\u00e9 Dinis Aveiro, a municipal gardener at the Junta de Freguesia of Santo Ant\\u00f3nio and part-time kit man for football club Andorinha. His great-grandmother on his father's side, Isabel da Piedade, an African woman, was born in the island of S\\u00e3o Vicente, in what was then Portuguese Cape Verde, and moved to Madeira Island at 16. He has one older brother, Hugo, and two older sisters, Elma and Liliana C\\u00e1tia \\\"Katia\\\". He was named after actor and U.S. President Ronald Reagan, whom his father was a fan of. His mother revealed that she wanted to abort him due to poverty, his father's alcoholism, and having too many children already, but her doctor refused to perform the procedure, as abortions were illegal in Portugal at that time. Ronaldo grew up in an impoverished Roman Catholic home, sharing a room with all his siblings.As a child, Ronaldo played for Andorinha from 1992 to 1995, where his father was the kit man, and later spent two years with Nacional. In 1997, aged 12, he went on a three-day trial with Sporting CP, who signed him for a fee of \\u00a31,500. He subsequently moved from Madeira to Lisbon to join Sporting CP's youth system. By age 14, while struggling with his school duties and responsibilities in Escola EB2 de Telheiras, his school in the Telheiras area of Lisbon, Ronaldo believed he had the ability to play semi-professionally and agreed with his mother and his tutor at Sporting CP, Leonel Pontes, to cease his education to focus entirely on football. With a troubled life as a student and living in Lisbon area away from his Madeiran family, he did not complete schooling beyond the 6th grade. While popular with other students at school, he had been expelled after throwing a chair at his teacher, who he said had \\\"disrespected\\\" him. One year later, he was diagnosed with tachycardia, a condition that could have forced him to give up playing football. Ronaldo underwent heart surgery where a laser was used to cauterise multiple cardiac pathways into one, altering his resting heart rate. He was discharged from the hospital hours after the procedure and resumed training a few days later. In 2021, Cristiano Ronaldo's mother, Dolores Aveiro, stated in an interview for Sporting CP's official television channel (Sporting TV) that her son would be a bricklayer if he hadn't become a professional football player.\\n\\n\\n== Club career ==\\n\\n\\n=== Sporting CP ===\\nAt age 16, Ronaldo was promoted from Sporting's youth team by first-team manager L\\u00e1szl\\u00f3 B\\u00f6l\\u00f6ni, who was impressed with his dribbling. He subsequently became the first player to play for the club's under-16, under-17 and under-18 teams, the B team and the first team, all within a single season.On 14 August 2002, Cristiano Ronaldo, then 17, played his first official match for a Sporting CP's senior team, in a UEFA Champions League qualifying round at Jos\\u00e9 Alvalade Stadium against Inter Milan. He came on in the 58th minute in place of To\\u00f1ito.As far as the Portuguese football league system's competitions is concerned, Sporting CP B was the 1st team in his senior career playing domestically, where he debuted in a 2\\u20131 away loss against Sport Clube Lusit\\u00e2nia on 1 September 2002, in a game for the Segunda Divis\\u00e3o B championship played in the Azores. On 29 September 2002, Ronaldo made his debut in the Primeira Liga, playing for Sporting CP's main team against Braga, and on 7 October, he scored two goals against Moreirense in their 3\\u20130 win. Over the course of the 2002\\u201303 season, his representatives suggested the player to Liverpool manager G\\u00e9rard Houllier and Barcelona president Joan Laporta. Manager Ars\\u00e8ne Wenger, who was interested in signing Ronaldo, met with him at Arsenal's stadium in November to discuss a possible transfer.Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson was determined to acquire Ronaldo on a permanent move urgently, after Sporting defeated United 3\\u20131 at the inauguration of the Est\\u00e1dio Jos\\u00e9 Alvalade on 6 August 2003. Initially, United had planned to sign Ronaldo and loan him back to Sporting for a year. Having been impressed by him, the United players urged Ferguson to sign him. After the game, Ferguson agreed to pay Sporting \\u00a312.24 million for what he considered to be \\\"one of the most exciting young players\\\" he had ever seen. A decade after his departure from the club, in 2013, Sporting honoured Ronaldo by selecting him to become their 100,000th member.\\n\\n\\n=== Manchester United ===\\n\\n\\n==== 2003\\u20132007: Development and breakthrough ====\\n\\nRonaldo's move to Manchester United was completed on 12 August 2003, too late for the 2003 FA Community Shield but in time for their game against Bolton Wanderers on the opening day of the 2003\\u201304 season, and made him the first Portuguese player to sign for the club. His transfer fee made him, at the time, the most expensive teenager in English football history. Although he requested the number 28, his number at Sporting, he received the squad number 7 shirt, which had previously been worn by such United players as George Best, Eric Cantona and David Beckham. Wearing the number 7 became an extra source of motivation for Ronaldo. A key element in his development during his time in England proved to be Ferguson, of whom he later said: \\\"He's been my father in sport, one of the most important and influential factors in my career.\\\"\\nRonaldo made his debut as a substitute in a 4\\u20130 home win over Bolton Wanderers in the Premier League on 16 August 2003, and received a standing ovation when he came on for Nicky Butt. His performance earned praise from Best, who hailed it as \\\"undoubtedly the most exciting debut\\\" he had ever seen. Ronaldo scored his first goal for Manchester United with a free-kick in a 3\\u20130 win over Portsmouth on 1 November. Three more league goals followed in the second half of the campaign, the last of which came against Aston Villa on the final day of the season, a match in which he also received the first red card of his career. Ronaldo ended his first season in English football by scoring the opening goal in United's 3\\u20130 win over Millwall in the 2004 FA Cup Final, earning his first trophy. BBC pundit Alan Hansen described him as the star of the final. The British press had been critical of Ronaldo during the season for his \\\"elaborate\\\" step-overs in trying to beat opponents, but teammate Gary Neville said he was \\\"not a show pony, but the real thing\\\", and predicted he would become a world-class player.\\n\\nRonaldo scored United's 1,000th Premier League goal on 29 October 2004, their only goal in a 4\\u20131 loss to Middlesbrough. A few weeks later, he signed a new contract with the club that extended his previous deal by two years to 2010. At the start of 2005, Ronaldo played two of his best matches of the 2004\\u201305 season, producing a goal and an assist against Aston Villa and scoring twice against rivals Arsenal. He played the full 120 minutes of the 2005 FA Cup Final against Arsenal, which ended in a goalless draw; although Ronaldo scored his attempt in the penalty shoot-out, United lost 5\\u20134. Ronaldo won his second trophy in English football, the Football League Cup, after scoring the third goal in United's 4\\u20130 final win over Wigan Athletic.During his third season in England, Ronaldo was involved in several incidents. He had a one-match ban imposed on him by UEFA for a \\\"one-fingered gesture\\\" towards Benfica fans, and was sent off in the Manchester derby (a 3\\u20131 defeat) for kicking Manchester City's former United player Andy Cole. Ronaldo clashed with a teammate, striker Ruud van Nistelrooy, who took offence at the winger's showboating style of play. Following the 2006 FIFA World Cup, in which he was involved in an incident where club teammate Wayne Rooney was sent off, Ronaldo publicly asked for a transfer, lamenting the lack of support he felt he had received from the club over the incident. United denied the possibility of him leaving the club.Although his World Cup altercation with Rooney resulted in Ronaldo being booed throughout the 2006\\u201307 season, it proved to be his break-out year, as he broke the 20-goal barrier for the first time and won his first Premier League title. An important factor in this success was his one-to-one training by first-team coach Ren\\u00e9 Meulensteen, who taught him to make himself more unpredictable, improve his teamwork, call for the ball and capitalise on goalscoring opportunities rather than waiting for the chance to score the aesthetically pleasing goals for which he was already known. He scored three consecutive braces at the end of December, against Aston Villa (a win that put United on top of the league), Wigan and Reading. Ronaldo was named the Premier League Player of the Month in November and December, becoming only the third player to receive consecutive honours.\\n\\n\\n==== 2007\\u20132008: Collective and individual success ====\\nAt the quarter-final stage of the 2006\\u201307 UEFA Champions League, Ronaldo scored his first goals in his 30th match in the competition, scoring twice in a 7\\u20131 win over Roma. He subsequently scored four minutes into the first semi-final leg against Milan, which ended in a 3\\u20132 win, but was marked out of the second leg as United lost 3\\u20130 at the San Siro. He also helped United reach the 2007 FA Cup Final, but the final against Chelsea ended in a 1\\u20130 defeat. Ronaldo scored the only goal in the Manchester derby on 5 May (his 50th goal for the club), as United won their first league title in four years. As a result of his performances, he amassed a host of personal awards for the season. He won the Professional Footballers' Association's Player's Player, Fans' Player and Young Player of the Year awards, as well as the Football Writers' Association's Footballer of the Year award, becoming the first player to win all four main PFA and FWA honours. His wages were raised to \\u00a3120,000 a week as part of a five-year contract extension. Ronaldo was named runner-up to Kak\\u00e1 for the 2007 Ballon d'Or, and came third, behind Kak\\u00e1 and Lionel Messi, in the running for the 2007 FIFA World Player of the Year award.Ronaldo scored his first hat-trick for United in a 6\\u20130 win against Newcastle United on 12 January 2008, which put United top of the league table. On 19 March, he captained United for the first time in a home win over Bolton and scored both goals in a 2\\u20130 win. His second goal was his 33rd of the campaign, surpassing George Best's total of 32 goals in the 1967\\u201368 season, setting the club's new single-season record by a midfielder. His 31 league goals earned him the Premier League Golden Boot, as well as the European Golden Shoe, which made him the first winger to win the latter award. He additionally received the PFA Players' Player of the Year and FWA Footballer of the Year awards for the second consecutive season. In the knockout stage of the Champions League, Ronaldo scored the decisive goal against Lyon to help United advance to the quarter-finals 2\\u20131 on aggregate; while playing as a striker, he scored with a header in the 3\\u20130 aggregate win over Roma. United reached the final against Chelsea in Moscow on 21 May, where, despite his opening goal being negated by an equaliser and his penalty kick being saved in the shoot-out, United emerged victorious 1\\u20131, winning the penalties 6\\u20135. As the Champions League top scorer, Ronaldo was named the UEFA Club Footballer of the Year.Ronaldo scored a total of 42 goals in all competitions during the 2007\\u201308 season, his most prolific campaign during his time in England. He missed three matches after headbutting a Portsmouth player at the start of the season, an experience he said taught him not to let opponents provoke him. As rumours circulated of Ronaldo's interest in moving to Real Madrid, United filed a tampering complaint with governing body FIFA over Madrid's alleged pursuit of their player, but they declined to take action. FIFA president Sepp Blatter asserted that the player should be allowed to leave his club, describing the situation as \\\"modern slavery\\\". Despite Ronaldo publicly agreeing with Blatter, he remained at United for another year.\\n\\n\\n==== 2008\\u20132009: Ballon d'Or and continued success ====\\nAhead of the 2008\\u201309 season, on 7 July, Ronaldo underwent ankle surgery, which kept him out of action for 10 weeks. Following his return, he scored his 100th goal in all competitions for United with the first of two free kicks in a 5\\u20130 win against Stoke City on 15 November, which meant he had now scored against all 19 opposition teams in the Premier League at the time. At the close of 2008, Ronaldo helped United win the 2008 FIFA Club World Cup in Japan, assisting the final-winning goal against Liga de Quito and winning the Silver Ball in the process. With his 2008 Ballon d'Or and 2008 FIFA World Player of the Year, Ronaldo became United's first Ballon d'Or winner since Best in 1968, and the first Premier League player to be named the FIFA World Player of the Year.His match-winning goal in the second leg against Porto, a 40-yard strike, earned him the inaugural FIFA Pusk\\u00e1s Award, presented by FIFA in recognition of the best goal of the year; he later called it the best goal he had ever scored. United advanced to the final in Rome, where he made little impact in United's 2\\u20130 defeat to Barcelona. Ronaldo ended his time in England with nine trophies, as United claimed their third successive league title and a Football League Cup. He finished the campaign with 26 goals in all competitions, 16 goals fewer than the previous season, in four more appearances. His final goal for United came on 10 May 2009 with a free kick in the Manchester derby at Old Trafford.\\n\\n\\n=== Real Madrid ===\\nAhead of the 2009\\u201310 season, Ronaldo joined Real Madrid for a world record transfer fee at the time of \\u00a380 million (\\u20ac94 million). His contract, which ran until 2015, was worth \\u20ac11 million per year and contained a \\u20ac1 billion buy-out clause. At least 80,000 fans attended his presentation at the Santiago Bernab\\u00e9u, surpassing the 25-year record of 75,000 fans who had welcomed Diego Maradona at Napoli. Since club captain Ra\\u00fal already wore the number 7 (the number Ronaldo wore at United), Ronaldo received the number 9 shirt, which was presented to him by former Madrid player Alfredo Di St\\u00e9fano.\\n\\n\\n==== 2009\\u20132013: World record transfer and La Liga title ====\\nRonaldo made his La Liga debut against Deportivo La Coru\\u00f1a on 29 August, scoring a penalty in a 3\\u20132 home win. He scored in each of his first four league games, the first Madrid player to do so. His first Champions League goals for the club followed with two free kicks in the first group match against Z\\u00fcrich. His strong start to the season was interrupted when he suffered an ankle injury in October while on international duty, which kept him sidelined for seven weeks. A week after his return, he received his first red card in Spain in a match against Almer\\u00eda. Midway through the season, Ronaldo finished second in the 2009 Ballon d'Or and the 2009 FIFA World Player of the Year awards, behind Messi. He finished the season with 33 goals in all competitions, including a hat-trick in a 4\\u20131 win against Mallorca on 5 May 2010, his first in La Liga, and became Real Madrid's highest goalscorer that season. Although Ronaldo helped amass a club record 96 points in the league, he did not win a trophy in his first season.Following Ra\\u00fal's departure, Ronaldo was given the number 7 shirt for Madrid before the 2010\\u201311 season. His subsequent return to his Ballon d'Or-winning form was epitomised when, for the first time in his career, he scored four goals in a single match during a 6\\u20131 rout against Racing Santander on 23 October. Ronaldo subsequently scored further hat-tricks against Athletic Bilbao, Levante, Villarreal and M\\u00e1laga. Despite his performances, he did not make the top three in the inaugural 2010 FIFA Ballon d'Or. During a historic series of four Cl\\u00e1sicos against rivals Barcelona in April 2011, Ronaldo scored twice to equal his personal record of 42 goals in all competitions. Though he failed to score in either leg of the Champions League semi-finals as Madrid were eliminated, he equalised from the penalty spot in the return league game and scored the match-winning goal in the 103rd minute of the 2011 Copa del Rey Final, winning his first trophy in Spain. His two goals in the last match of the season against Almer\\u00eda made him the first player in La Liga to score 40 goals. In addition to the Pichichi Trophy, Ronaldo won the European Golden Shoe for a second time, becoming the first player to win the award in different leagues.\\nDuring the following season, Ronaldo achieved a new personal best of 60 goals in all competitions. He finished as runner-up to Messi for the 2011 FIFA Ballon d'Or, after scoring hat-tricks against Real Zaragoza, Rayo Vallecano, M\\u00e1laga, Osasuna and Sevilla, the last of which put Madrid on top of the league by the season's midway point. Ronaldo found greater team success in the league, helping Madrid win their first league title in four years with a record 100 points. Following a hat-trick against Levante as Madrid further increased their lead over Barcelona, he scored his 100th league goal for Madrid in a 5\\u20131 win over Real Sociedad on 24 March 2012, a milestone he reached in just 92 matches across three seasons, breaking the previous club record held by Ferenc Pusk\\u00e1s. Another hat-trick in the Madrid derby against Atl\\u00e9tico Madrid brought his total to 40 league goals, equalling his record of the previous season. His final league goal of the season, against Mallorca, took his total to 46 goals, four short of the new record set by Messi, though he became the first player to score against all 19 opposition teams in a single La Liga season.Ronaldo began the 2012\\u201313 season by lifting the 2012 Supercopa de Espa\\u00f1a, his third trophy in Spain. With a goal in each leg, he helped Madrid win the Spanish Super Cup on away goals following a 4\\u20134 aggregate draw against Barcelona. Although Ronaldo publicly commented that he was unhappy with a \\\"professional issue\\\" within the club, prompted by his refusal to celebrate his 150th goal for Madrid, his goalscoring rate did not suffer. After netting a hat-trick, including two penalties, against Deportivo, he scored his first hat-trick in the Champions League in a 4\\u20131 win over Ajax. Four days later, he became the first player to score in six successive Cl\\u00e1sicos when he hit a brace in a 2\\u20132 draw at Camp Nou. His performances again saw Ronaldo voted second in the running for the 2012 FIFA Ballon d'Or, behind four-time winner Messi.\\n\\n\\n==== 2013\\u20132015: Consecutive Ballon d'Or wins and La D\\u00e9cima ====\\nFollowing the 2012\\u201313 winter break, Ronaldo captained Madrid for the first time in an official match, scoring twice to lift 10-man Madrid to a 4\\u20133 win over Sociedad on 6 January. He subsequently became the first non-Spanish player in 60 years to captain Madrid in El Clasico on 30 January, a match which also marked his 500th club appearance. Three days prior, he had scored his 300th club goal as part of a perfect hat-trick against Getafe. He scored his 200th goal for Madrid on 8 May in a 6\\u20132 win against M\\u00e1laga, reaching the landmark in 197 games. He helped Madrid reach the 2013 Copa del Rey Final by scoring twice in El Cl\\u00e1sico, which marked the sixth successive match at Camp Nou in which he had scored, a club record. In the final, he headed the opening goal of an eventual 2\\u20131 extra time defeat to Atl\\u00e9tico, but was shown a red card for violent conduct. In the first knockout round of the Champions League, Ronaldo faced his former club Manchester United for the first time. After scoring the equaliser in a 1\\u20131 draw at home, he scored the winning goal in a 2\\u20131 win on his first return to Old Trafford. He did not celebrate scoring against his former club as a mark of respect. After scoring three goals against Galatasaray in the quarters, he scored Madrid's only goal in the 4\\u20131 away defeat to Borussia Dortmund in the semi-finals and Real were eliminated at the semi-final stage for the third consecutive year despite a 2\\u20130 win in the second leg.\\nAt the start of the 2013\\u201314 season, Ronaldo signed a new contract that extended his stay by three years to 2018, with a salary of \\u20ac17 million net, making him briefly the highest-paid player in football. He was joined at the club by winger Gareth Bale, whose world record transfer fee of \\u20ac100 million surpassed the fee Madrid had paid for Ronaldo four years prior. Together with striker Karim Benzema, they formed an attacking trio popularly dubbed \\\"BBC\\\", an acronym of Bale, Benzema and Cristiano, and a play on the name of the British public service broadcaster, the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC). By late November, Ronaldo had scored 32 goals from 22 matches for both club and country, including hat-tricks against Galatasaray, Sevilla, Real Sociedad, Northern Ireland, and Sweden. He ended 2013 with 69 goals in 59 appearances, his highest year-end goal tally. He received the 2013 FIFA Ballon d'Or, an amalgamation of the Ballon d'Or and the FIFA World Player of the Year award, for the first time in his career.Concurrently with his individual achievements, Ronaldo enjoyed his greatest team success in Spain to date, as he helped Madrid win La D\\u00e9cima, their tenth European Cup. His goal in a 3\\u20130 home win over Dortmund (his 100th Champions League match) took his total for the season to 14 goals, equalling the record Messi had set two years before. After hitting a brace in a 4\\u20130 defeat of Bayern Munich at the Allianz Arena, he scored from the penalty spot in the 120th minute of the 4\\u20131 final win over Atl\\u00e9tico, becoming the first player to score in two European Cup finals for two different winning teams. His overall performance in the final was subdued as a result of patellar tendinitis and related hamstring problems, which had plagued him in the last months of the campaign. Ronaldo played the final against medical advice, later commenting: \\\"In your life you do not win without sacrifices and you must take risks\\\". As the competition's top goalscorer for the third time, with a record 17 goals, he was named the UEFA Best Player in Europe.In the Copa del Rey, Ronaldo helped Madrid reach the final by scoring two penalties against Atl\\u00e9tico at the Vicente Calder\\u00f3n, the first of which meant he had now scored in every single minute of a 90-minute football match. His continued issues with his knee and thigh caused him to miss the final, where Madrid defeated Barcelona 2\\u20131 to claim the trophy. Ronaldo scored 31 goals in 30 league games, which earned him the Pichichi and the European Golden Shoe, receiving the latter award jointly with Liverpool striker Luis Su\\u00e1rez. Among his haul was his 400th career goal, in 653 appearances for club and country, which came with a brace against Celta Vigo on 6 January; he dedicated his goals to compatriot Eus\\u00e9bio, who had died two days before. A last-minute, back-heeled volley scored against Valencia on 4 May (his 50th goal in all competitions) was recognised as the best goal of the season by the Liga Nacional de F\\u00fatbol Profesional, which additionally named Ronaldo the Best Player in La Liga.\\nDuring the 2014\\u201315 season, Ronaldo set a new personal best of 61 goals, starting with both goals in Madrid's 2\\u20130 win over Sevilla in the UEFA Super Cup. He subsequently achieved his best-ever goalscoring start to a league campaign, with 15 goals in the first eight rounds. His record 23rd La Liga hat-trick, scored against Celta Vigo on 6 December, made him the fastest player to reach 200 goals in La Liga, reaching the milestone in 178th matches. After winning the 2014 FIFA Club World Cup, Ronaldo received the 2014 Ballon d'Or, joining Johan Cruyff, Michel Platini and Marco van Basten as a three-time recipient. Madrid finished in second place in La Liga and exited at the semi-final stage in the Champions League. In the latter competition, Ronaldo extended his run of scoring away to a record 12 matches with his strike in a 2\\u20130 win against Schalke 04. He scored both of his side's goals in the semi-finals against Juventus, where Madrid were eliminated 3\\u20132 on aggregate. With 10 goals, he finished as top scorer for a third consecutive season, alongside Messi and Neymar. On 5 April, he scored five goals in a game for the first time in his career, including an eight-minute hat-trick, in a 9\\u20131 rout of Granada. His 300th goal for his club followed three days later in a 2\\u20130 win against Rayo Vallecano. Subsequent hat-tricks against Sevilla, Espanyol and Getafe took his number of hat-tricks for Madrid to 31, surpassing Di St\\u00e9fano's club record of 28. He finished the season with 48 goals, winning a second consecutive Pichichi and the European Golden Shoe for a record fourth time.\\n\\n\\n==== 2015\\u20132017: All-time Madrid top scorer ====\\nAt the start of his seventh season at Madrid, the 2015\\u201316 campaign, Ronaldo became the club's all-time top scorer, first in the league and then in all competitions. His five-goal haul in a 6\\u20130 away win over Espanyol on 12 September took his tally in La Liga to 230 goals in 203 games, surpassing the club's previous record holder, Ra\\u00fal. A month later, on 17 October, he again surpassed Ra\\u00fal when he scored the second goal in a 3\\u20130 defeat of Levante at the Bernab\\u00e9u to take his overall total for the club to 324 goals. Ronaldo also became the all-time top scorer in the Champions League with a hat-trick in the first group match against Shakhtar Donetsk, having finished the previous season level with Messi on 77 goals. Two goals against Malm\\u00f6 FF in a 2\\u20130 away win on 30 September saw him reach the milestone of 500 career goals for club and country. He subsequently became the first player to score double figures in the competition's group stage, setting the record at 11 goals, including another four-goal haul against Malm\\u00f6.\\nRonaldo's four goals in a 7\\u20131 home win over Celta de Vigo on 5 March 2016 took his total to 252 goals in La Liga, becoming the competition's second-highest scorer in history behind Messi. He scored a hat-trick against VfL Wolfsburg to send his club into the Champions League semi-finals. The treble took his tally in the competition to 16 goals, making him the top scorer for the fourth consecutive season and the fifth overall. Suffering apparent fitness issues, Ronaldo gave a poorly-received performance in the final against Atl\\u00e9tico, in a repeat of the 2014 final, though his penalty in the subsequent shoot-out secured Madrid's 11th victory. For the sixth successive year, he ended the season having scored over 50 goals across all competitions. For his efforts during the season, he received the UEFA Best Player in Europe Award for a second time.Ronaldo missed Madrid's first three matches of the 2016\\u201317 season, including the 2016 UEFA Super Cup against Sevilla, as he continued to rehabilitate the knee injury he suffered against France in the Euro 2016 final. On 15 September, he did not celebrate his late free kick equaliser against Sporting CP in the Champions League, with Ronaldo stating post match that \\\"they made me who I am\\\".

He then scored a hat-trick in the 4\\u20132 win over Japanese club Kashima Antlers in the final. Ronaldo finished the tournament as top scorer with four goals and was also named player of the tournament. He won the 2016 Ballon d'Or, his fourth, and the inaugural 2016 The Best FIFA Men's Player, a revival of the former FIFA World Player of the Year, largely owing to his success with Portugal in winning Euro 2016.\\nIn the 2016\\u201317 UEFA Champions League quarter-finals against Bayern in April, Ronaldo scored both goals in a 2\\u20131 away win which saw him make history by becoming the first player to reach 100 goals in UEFA club competition.

He finished the season with 42 goals in all competitions as he helped Madrid to win their first La Liga title since 2012. In the Champions League Final, Ronaldo scored two goals in a 4\\u20131 victory over Juventus to take him to 12 goals for the season, making him the competition's top goalscorer for the fifth straight season (sixth overall), as well as the first player to score in three finals in the Champions League era; the second goal was the 600th of his senior career. Madrid also became the first team to win back-to-back finals in the Champions League era.\\n\\n\\n==== 2017\\u20132018: Fifth Ballon d'Or and fifth Champions League win ====\\nAt the start of the 2017\\u201318 season, Ronaldo scored Madrid's second goal in the 80th minute of a 3\\u20131 win over Barcelona in the first leg of the 2017 Supercopa de Espa\\u00f1a at Camp Nou; however, he was sent off two minutes later and missed the second leg.

Described as a \\\"PlayStation goal\\\" by Juventus defender Andrea Barzagli, with Ronaldo's foot approximately 7 ft 7 in (2.31 m) off the ground, it garnered him a standing ovation from the opposing fans in the stadium as well as a plethora of plaudits from peers, pundits and coaches. On 11 April, he scored in the second leg at home to Juventus, a 98th-minute injury time penalty in a 3\\u20131 defeat, meaning Madrid advanced 4\\u20133 on aggregate.

In the final on 26 May, Madrid defeated Liverpool 3\\u20131, winning Ronaldo his fifth Champions League title, the first player to do so. He finished as the top scorer of the tournament for the sixth consecutive season with 15 goals. After the final, Ronaldo referred to his time with Madrid in the past tense, sparking speculation that he could leave the club.\\n\\n\\n=== Juventus ===\\nDespite months of negotiation to sign a new Real Madrid contract, on 10 July 2018, Ronaldo signed a four-year contract with Italian club Juventus after completing a \\u20ac100 million transfer, which included an additional \\u20ac12 million in other fees and solidarity contributions to Ronaldo's youth clubs. The transfer was the highest ever for a player over 30 years old, and the highest paid by an Italian club. Upon signing, Ronaldo cited his need for a new challenge as his rationale for departing Madrid, but later attributed the transfer to the lack of support he felt was shown by club president Florentino P\\u00e9rez.\\n\\n\\n==== 2018\\u20132020: Consecutive Serie A titles ====\\nOn 18 August, Ronaldo made his debut in a 3\\u20132 away win against Chievo Verona.

Though manager Massimiliano Allegri confirmed it was his decision due to Ronaldo's fitness, it came amid reports Ronaldo would depart the club before the closure of the transfer window, and Ronaldo would tell Allegri he had \\\"no intention\\\" of remaining a Juventus player. On 26 August, Ronaldo and his agent Jorge Mendes reached a verbal agreement with Manchester City over personal terms, but the club pulled out of the deal the following day due to the overall cost of the transfer. On the same day, it was confirmed that City's rivals Manchester United, Ronaldo's former club, were in advanced talks to sign him, while former manager Alex Ferguson and several ex-teammates had been in contact to persuade him to re-sign for United.\\n\\n\\n=== Return to Manchester United ===\\n\\n\\n==== 2021\\u20132022: 100 Premier League goals and team struggles ====\\nOn 27 August 2021, Manchester United announced they had reached an agreement with Juventus to re-sign Ronaldo, subject to agreement of personal terms, visa and medical. The transfer was for an initial \\u00a312.85 million, with a two-year contract plus an optional year, and was confirmed on 31 August. Ronaldo was given the number 7 shirt after Edinson Cavani agreed to switch to 21. The first 24 hours of Ronaldo's shirt sales was reported to have broken the all-time record following a transfer, overtaking Messi after his move to Paris Saint-Germain.\\nOn 11 September, Ronaldo made his second debut at Old Trafford, scoring the opening two goals in a 4\\u20131 league victory against Newcastle United. On 29 September, he scored a last-minute winner in United's 2\\u20131 victory at home to Villarreal in the Champions League, and overtook Iker Casillas as the player with the most appearances in the competition. In the next Champions League fixture on 20 October, Ronaldo again scored a last minute winner, helping United overturn a two-goal deficit in a 3\\u20132 home victory against Atalanta, and scored both goals, including a last minute equaliser, in the reverse fixture against Atalanta on 2 November. On 23 November, Ronaldo became the first player to score in five consecutive matches of a Champions League campaign for an English club, after opening United's 2\\u20130 victory away against Villarreal, with his six goals being crucial to United's qualifying for the round of 16 as group winners. On 2 December, Ronaldo netted two goals in a 3\\u20132 home league win against Arsenal, which saw him surpass 800 career goals.The following month, after enduring a fractured relationship with his teammates and interim manager Ralf Rangnick, his performances and his team's declined during the season, with Ronaldo equalling his worst goalscoring run since 2010 during his time with Real Madrid, being two months without scoring a goal, before scoring his first goal in the new year, opening United's 2\\u20130 win home against Brighton & Hove Albion on 15 February 2022. Following a hamstring injury, which saw him miss the Manchester derby against Manchester City, Ronaldo made his return from injury on 12 March, scoring a hat-trick in a 3\\u20132 victory against Tottenham Hotspur, which saw him pass Josef Bican's record for goals scored in professional football with 807 career goals, although the Football Association of the Czech Republic claimed that Bican had scored 821 career goals.

After scoring in the following matches against Chelsea and Brentford, he was named the Premier League Player of the Month for April.He finished the season with 24 goals in all competitions, 18 of those goals being in the Premier League, making him the third-highest goalscorer in the league behind Golden Boot winners Mohamed Salah and Son Heung-min, being named in the Premier League Team of the Year and the winner of United's Sir Matt Busby Player of the Year award, given to the club's best player from the previous season; however, with United finishing in a disappointing sixth place and qualifying for the UEFA Europa League, Ronaldo went trophyless for the first time since 2010.\\n\\n\\n==== 2022: Final season and departure ====\\nAfter growing dissatisfaction with the direction of United on and off the field, Ronaldo missed the club's pre-season tour of Thailand and Australia due to family reasons, amid reports of his desire to leave to join a club competing in the Champions League, despite incoming manager Erik ten Hag insisting that he was not for sale and was part of the club's plans. His agent Jorge Mendes began negotiating with various clubs for a transfer on loan or on a free transfer, including Bayern Munich, Paris Saint-Germain and Chelsea, with the latter club's new owner Todd Boehly being keen on a possible transfer. However, due to his age, overall cost of a transfer and high wages demands, multiple European clubs rejected the opportunity to sign him, including Chelsea after their manager Thomas Tuchel did not approve his signing.\\nHaving failed to secure a transfer, Ronaldo lost his place in the starting line-up to Marcus Rashford and Anthony Martial, mostly featuring in Europa League matches. He scored his first goal in the competition aged 37, converting a penalty to make it 2\\u20130 against Sheriff Tiraspol on 15 September. On 2 October, Ronaldo was an unused substitute in United's 6\\u20133 loss to Manchester City, with ten Hag saying that he refused to bring him on out of \\\"respect for his big career\\\". On 9 October, Ronaldo came on as a substitute and scored his 700th career club goal in a 2\\u20131 win against Everton. Ten days later, Ronaldo refused to be brought on as a substitute during a home game against Tottenham and left the ground before the full-time whistle; Ten Hag punished him by dropping him from the squad for an upcoming fixture with Chelsea, and made him train separately from the first team. Following discussions with the manager, Ronaldo returned to training and started in United's home win over Sheriff on 27 October, scoring the third goal and ensuring United's qualification to the Europa League knockout stage. Ten Hag named Ronaldo as captain for a 3\\u20131 defeat to Aston Villa on 6 November, saying that Ronaldo was \\\"an important part of the squad, we are happy with him and now he has to take even more of the leader role\\\". Ronaldo then missed United's following matches before the World Cup break, with Ten Hag saying that Ronaldo was ill.On 14 November, an interview with Piers Morgan was published, where Ronaldo said that he felt \\\"betrayed\\\" by Ten Hag and senior executives who wanted Ronaldo to leave the club, and accused the club of doubting him regarding the illness of his daughter that led him to miss pre-season, adding that he did not respect ten Hag \\\"because he doesn't show respect for me\\\", leading him to be disappointed with the communication of the club. Ronaldo claimed that ten Hag deliberately provoked him by first leaving him on the bench against City, and then wanting to bring him on in the final moments against Tottenham, but added that he regretted his decision to leave early. He also questioned the appointment of Rangnick the previous season as he was a \\\"sporting director and not even a coach\\\". On the club itself, Ronaldo stated there was \\\"no evolution\\\" since the departure of former manager Alex Ferguson in 2013, despite expecting changes in \\\"technology, infrastructure\\\". Ronaldo claimed that the Glazer family \\\"did not care about the club\\\" as he never spoke with them, and described United as a \\\"marketing club\\\". Following the interview, which aired in two-parts on 16 and 17 November, United began seeking legal action over whether Ronaldo had breached his contract, and were looking to terminate his contract. On 22 November, Ronaldo's contract was terminated by mutual agreement with immediate effect.\\n\\n\\n=== Al Nassr ===\\nOn 30 December 2022, Saudi club Al Nassr reached an agreement for Ronaldo to join the club effective 1 January 2023, signing a contract until 2025. As reported by Fabrizio Romano of The Guardian, Ronaldo received the highest football salary in history, worth \\u20ac200 million per year; this included an annual guaranteed football salary of \\u20ac90 million, with commercial and sponsorship deals included bringing his total annual salary to \\u20ac200 million. He was also reportedly paid a signing-on bonus in the region of \\u20ac100 million. According to media reports, Ronaldo rejected a move to Major League Soccer club Sporting Kansas City to join Al Nassr.\\n\\n\\n==== 2023: Debut season and league runner-up ====\\nRonaldo was due to appear in a match against Al-Tai on 5 January 2023, but had to serve a two-match ban incurred while he was still at Manchester United for knocking a phone out of a 14-year-old Everton fan's hand after a 1\\u20130 loss at Goodison Park in April 2022. On 19 January, Ronaldo played for the first time since transferring to Saudi Arabia, in an exhibition game featuring a combined team of Riyadh's Al Nassr and Al Hilal players against Paris Saint-Germain. Ronaldo scored twice in a 5\\u20134 loss. He made his debut for Al Nassr on 22 January, as club captain, playing the full 90 minutes of a 1\\u20130 win over Al-Ettifaq, and scored his first goal in a 2\\u20132 draw against Al-Fateh by converting a last-minute penalty. On 9 February, Ronaldo scored all four goals in a 4\\u20130 win over Al Wehda, his first goal of the match being his 500th career league goal. On 25 February, he scored his second hat-trick for the club, helping his side to a 3\\u20130 away league victory against Damac, in the process, he became the first player in the history of Saudi Pro League to score a hat-trick in the first half of a match. Ronaldo was awarded the Player of the Month award for February after scoring eight goals and assisting twice. Ronaldo spent another season without winning a league title, as Al Nassr finished second in the league in the 2022\\u201323 season.\\n\\n\\n==== 2023\\u2013present: Arab Club Champions Cup winner ====\\nRonaldo's signing for Al-Nassr resulted in increased popularity both domestically and internationally of the Saudi Pro League, with various European players such as Karim Benzema, Sadio Man\\u00e9, N'Golo Kant\\u00e9, R\\u00faben Neves, Riyad Mahrez, Roberto Firmino and Neymar moving to the Saudi Pro League during the summer transfer window, crediting Ronaldo as one of the main factors for moving to the league.He scored his first goal of the 2023\\u201324 season in a 4\\u20131 win over Union Monastirienne in the Arab Club Champions Cup on 31 July. In the next Arab Club Champions Cup fixture on 3 August, Ronaldo scored a late equaliser against Zamalek, to help his side secure a 1\\u20131 draw and qualify for the quarter-finals in second place of their group. In the semi-finals on 9 August, Ronaldo scored the only goal of a win over Al-Shorta, converting a penalty to help Al Nassr reach their first ever Arab Club Champions Cup final. In the final on 12 August, Ronaldo scored both goals for a ten-man Al Nassr as they defeated rivals Al-Hilal 2\\u20131 after extra time to win the competition for the first time in their history. Ronaldo was awarded the competition's top scorer award having scored six goals in the competition.\\nOn 18 August, Ronaldo made his first league appearance of the season in a 2\\u20130 defeat to Al-Taawoun, and scored his first hat-trick of the season in a 5\\u20130 away win against Al-Fateh a week later. On 29 August, Ronaldo scored twice and assisted once in a 4\\u20130 win against rivals Al-Shabab. Ronaldo was awarded the SPL Player of the Month award for August after scoring five goals and assisting twice. On 2 September, he scored a goal in Al-Nassr's 5\\u20131 away win against Al-Hazem, his 850th senior career goal. On 19 September, Ronaldo made his AFC Champions League debut, starting in a 2\\u20130 win over Persepolis, becoming the first player in football history to record 1000 career games unbeaten (776 wins and 224 draws). Ronaldo received the SPL Player of the Month award for a second consecutive month after recording five goals and three assists in September. On 2 October, he scored his first AFC Champions League goal in the home fixture against Istiklol, the equaliser in an eventual 3\\u20131 win. On 8 December, Ronaldo made his 1200th senior career appearance for club and country, scoring the first goal of a 4\\u20131 win over Al-Riyadh. On December 30, Ronaldo closed the 4\\u20131 win over Al Taawon. At the close of the year, Ronaldo scored 54 goals in all competitions for Al-Nassr and Portugal, making him the outright top scorer in 2023. His 54 goals was the most goals he had scored in a calendar year since 2016, and sixth time he achieved that feat in his career (2011, 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016 and 2023).In the first knockout round of the AFC Champions League, Ronaldo faced fellow Saudi Arabian club Al-Fayha. After scoring the winner in a 1\\u20130 win away in his 1000th club appearance, he scored the winning goal in a 2\\u20130 win at home, helping Al-Nassr reach the quarter-finals of the competition. On 25 February 2024, Ronaldo was filmed making an alleged obscene gesture towards rival fans who were jeering him after a 3\\u20132 victory over Al-Shabab. This act resulted in Ronaldo being suspended four days later for one match by the Disciplinary and Ethics Committee of the Saudi Arabia Football Federation. On 11 March, Ronaldo became the first football player to achieve 800 career wins following a match against Al Ain in the second leg of the AFC Champions League quarter-finals. Four days later, Ronaldo scored his 50th goal for Al-Nassr, netting a penalty in a narrow 1\\u20130 win over rivals Al-Ahli.\\n\\n\\n== International career ==\\n\\n\\n=== 2001\\u20132007: Youth level and senior debut ===\\nRonaldo began his international career with Portugal under-15 in 2001. During his international youth career, Ronaldo would represent the under-15, under-17, under-20, under-21 and under-23 national sides, amassing 34 youth caps and scoring 18 goals overall.Aged 18, Ronaldo made his first senior appearance for Portugal in a 1\\u20130 win over Kazakhstan on 20 August 2003, coming on as a half-time substitute for Lu\\u00eds Figo. He was subsequently called up for UEFA Euro 2004, held in his home country, and scored his first international goal in a 2\\u20131 group stage loss to eventual champions Greece, his eighth appearance for Portugal. After converting his penalty in a shoot-out against England in the quarter-finals, he helped Portugal reach the final by scoring the opening goal in a 2\\u20131 win over the Netherlands. He was featured in the team of the tournament, having provided two assists in addition to his two goals.Ronaldo was Portugal's second-highest scorer in their qualification group for the 2006 FIFA World Cup with seven goals. During the tournament, he scored his first World Cup goal against Iran with a penalty kick in Portugal's second match of the group stage. At the age of 21 years and 132 days, Ronaldo became the youngest ever goalscorer for Portugal at a World Cup finals. In Portugal's infamously dirty round of 16 match against the Netherlands, Ronaldo was forced off injured in the first half after a tackle from Dutch defender Khalid Boulahrouz. Following Portugal's 1\\u20130 win, Ronaldo accused Boulahrouz of intentionally trying to injure him, although he recovered in time to play in the next game. In Portugal's quarter-final against England, Ronaldo's Manchester United teammate Wayne Rooney was sent off for stamping on Portugal defender Ricardo Carvalho. Although the referee later clarified that the red card was only due to Rooney's infraction, the English media speculated that Ronaldo had influenced his decision by aggressively complaining, after which he was seen in replays winking at Portugal's bench following Rooney's dismissal. Ronaldo went on to score the vital winning penalty during the shoot-out which sent Portugal into the semi-finals. Ronaldo was subsequently booed during their 1\\u20130 semi-final defeat to France. FIFA's Technical Study Group overlooked him for the tournament's Best Young Player award and handed it to Germany's Lukas Podolski, citing his behaviour as a factor in the decision. Following the 2006 World Cup, Ronaldo would go on to represent Portugal in four qualifying games for Euro 2008, scoring two goals in the process.\\n\\n\\n=== 2007\\u20132012: Assuming captaincy ===\\nOne day after turning 22, Ronaldo captained Portugal for the first time in a friendly game against Brazil on 6 February 2007, as requested by Portuguese Football Federation (FPF) president Carlos Silva, who had died two days earlier. Ahead of Euro 2008, he was given the number 7 shirt for the first time. While he scored eight goals in qualifications, the second-highest tally, he scored just one goal in the tournament, netting the second goal of their 3\\u20131 win in the group stage match against the Czech Republic. In the same game, he also set-up Portugal's third goal in injury time, which was scored by Quaresma, and was named man of the match for his performance. Portugal were eliminated in the quarter-finals with a 3\\u20132 loss against eventual finalists Germany.After Portugal's unsuccessful performance at Euro 2008, Luiz Felipe Scolari was replaced as coach by Carlos Queiroz, formerly the assistant manager at United. Queiroz made Ronaldo the squad's permanent captain in July 2008. Ronaldo failed to score a single goal in the qualification for the 2010 World Cup, as Portugal narrowly avoided a premature elimination from the tournament with a play-off victory over Bosnia and Herzegovina. In the group stage of the World Cup, he was named man of the match in all three matches, against Ivory Coast, North Korea and Brazil. His only goal of the tournament came in their 7\\u20130 rout of North Korea, which marked his first international goal in 16 months. Portugal's World Cup ended with a 1\\u20130 loss against eventual champions Spain in the round of 16.Ronaldo scored seven goals in qualifications for Euro 2012, including two strikes against Bosnia and Herzegovina in the play-offs, to send Portugal into the tournament, where they were drawn in a \\\"group of death\\\". In the last group stage game against the Netherlands, Ronaldo scored twice to secure a 2\\u20131 win. He scored a header in the quarter-final against the Czech Republic to give his team a 1\\u20130 win. In both games against the Netherlands and the Czech Republic he was named man of the match. After the semi-finals against Spain ended scoreless, Portugal were eliminated in the penalty shoot-out. Ronaldo did not take a penalty as he had been slated to take the unused fifth slot. Ronaldo's own teammate, Nani, said that Ronaldo \\\"demanded\\\" to take the last penalty. As the joint top scorer with three goals, alongside five other players, he was again included in the team of the tournament.\\n\\n\\n=== 2012\\u20132016: All-time Portugal top scorer and European champion ===\\nDuring the qualification for the 2014 World Cup, Ronaldo scored a total of eight goals. A qualifying match on 17 October 2012, a 1\\u20131 draw against Northern Ireland, earned him his 100th cap. His first international hat-trick also came against Northern Ireland, when he scored three times in a 15-minute spell of a 4\\u20132 qualifying win on 6 September 2013. After Portugal failed to qualify during the regular campaign, Ronaldo scored all four of the team's goals in the play-offs against Sweden, billed as a battle between Ronaldo and Zlatan Ibrahimovi\\u0107, which ensured their place at the tournament. His hat-trick in the second leg took his international tally to 47 goals, equalling Pauleta's record. Ronaldo subsequently scored twice in a 5\\u20131 friendly win over Cameroon on 5 March 2014 to become his country's all-time top scorer.Ronaldo took part in the tournament despite suffering from patellar tendinitis and a related thigh injury, potentially risking his career. Ronaldo later commented: \\\"If we had two or three Cristiano Ronaldos in the team I would feel more comfortable. But we don't.\\\" Despite ongoing doubts over his fitness, being forced to abort practice twice, Ronaldo played the full 90 minutes of the opening match against Germany, although he was unable to prevent a 4\\u20130 defeat. After assisting an injury-time 2\\u20132 equaliser against the United States, he scored a late match-winning goal in a 2\\u20131 win over Ghana. His 50th international goal made him the first Portuguese to play and score in three World Cups. Portugal were eliminated from the tournament at the close of the group stage on goal difference.\\nRonaldo scored five goals, including a hat-trick against Armenia, in the qualification for Euro 2016. With the only goal in another win over Armenia on 14 November 2014, he reached 23 goals in the UEFA European Championship, including qualifying matches, to become the competition's all-time leading goalscorer. At the start of the tournament, Ronaldo failed to convert his chances in Portugal's draws against Iceland and Austria, despite taking 20 shots on goal. In the latter match, he overtook Figo as Portugal's most capped player with his 128th international appearance, which ended scoreless after he missed a penalty in the second half. With two goals in the last match of the group stage, a 3\\u20133 draw against Hungary, Ronaldo became the first player to score in four European Championships, having made a record 17 appearances in the tournament. Although placed third in their group behind Hungary and Iceland, his team qualified for the knockout round as a result of the competition's newly expanded format, despite not winning any of their games.In Portugal's first knockout match, Ronaldo's only attempt on goal was parried by Croatia's goalkeeper Danijel Suba\\u0161i\\u0107 into the path of Ricardo Quaresma, whose finish then secured a 1\\u20130 win late in extra time. After his team progressed past Poland on penalties, with Ronaldo scoring Portugal's opening penalty, he became the first player to participate in three European Championship semi-finals; he scored the opener in a 2\\u20130 win against Wales, equalling Michel Platini as the competition's all-time top scorer with nine goals. In the final against hosts France, Ronaldo was forced off after just 25 minutes following a challenge from Dimitri Payet, despite multiple treatments and attempts to play on, he was stretchered off the pitch and replaced by Quaresma. During extra time, substitute Eder scored in the 109th minute to earn Portugal a 1\\u20130 victory. As team captain, Ronaldo lifted the trophy in celebration of his country's first triumph in a major tournament. He was awarded the Silver Boot as the joint second-highest goalscorer, with three goals and three assists, and was named to the team of the tournament for the third time in his career.\\n\\n\\n=== 2016\\u20132018: Post-European Championship victory and World Cup ===\\nFollowing the Euro 2016 success, Ronaldo played his first professional match on his home island of Madeira on 28 March 2017 at age 32, opening a 2\\u20133 friendly defeat to Sweden at the Est\\u00e1dio dos Barreiros. With the goal, he tied with Miroslav Klose on 71 goals as the third-highest scoring European in international football.In Portugal's opening match of the 2017 FIFA Confederations Cup against Mexico on 17 June, Ronaldo set up Quaresma's opening goal in a 2\\u20132 draw. Three days later, he scored in a 1\\u20130 win over hosts Russia. On 24 June, he scored from a penalty in a 4\\u20130 win over New Zealand, which saw Portugal top their group and advance to the semi-finals of the competition; with his 75th international goal, Ronaldo also equalled S\\u00e1ndor Kocsis as the second-highest European international goalscorer of all time, behind only Ferenc Pusk\\u00e1s. He was named man of the match in all three of Portugal's group stage matches. Ronaldo left the competition early; after Chile defeated Portugal 3\\u20130 on penalties in the semi-finals, he was allowed to return home to be with his newborn children, and missed Portugal's third-place play-off match in which Portugal defeated Mexico 2\\u20131 after extra time.\\nOn 31 August 2017, Ronaldo scored a hat-trick in a 5\\u20131 win in a 2018 World Cup qualifying match over the Faroe Islands, which saw him overtake Pel\\u00e9 and equal Hussein Saeed as the joint-fifth-highest goalscorer in international football with 78 goals. These goals brought his tally in the World Cup qualifiers to 14, equalling Predrag Mijatovi\\u0107's record for most goals in a single UEFA qualifying campaign, and also saw him break the record for the most goals scored in a European qualifying group, overtaking the previous record of 13 goals set by David Healy and Robert Lewandowski. Ronaldo's hat-trick took his World Cup qualifying goals total to 29, making him the highest scorer in UEFA qualifiers, ahead of Andriy Shevchenko, and the highest goalscorer in World Cup qualifying and finals matches combined with 32 goals, ahead of Miroslav Klose. Ronaldo later added to this tally by scoring a goal against Andorra in a 2\\u20130 win.On 15 June 2018, Ronaldo became the oldest player to score a hat-trick in a FIFA World Cup match, helping Portugal secure a 3\\u20133 draw against Spain (his third goal a 30-yard curling free kick with two minutes remaining) in their opening match. In doing so, he became the first Portuguese player to score a goal in four World Cups and one of four players of any nationality to do so. On 20 June, Ronaldo scored the only goal in a 1\\u20130 win against Morocco, breaking Pusk\\u00e1s' record as the highest European goalscorer of all time, with 85 international goals. In the final group match against Iran on 25 June, Ronaldo missed a penalty in an eventual 1\\u20131 draw which saw Portugal progress to the second round as group runners-up behind Spain. On 30 June, Portugal were eliminated following a 2\\u20131 defeat to Uruguay in the last 16. For his performances in the tournament, Ronaldo was named in the World Cup Dream Team.\\n\\n\\n=== 2018\\u20132020: Nations League title and 100 international goals ===\\nAfter the World Cup, Ronaldo missed six international matches, including the entire league phase of the 2018\\u201319 UEFA Nations League, but played for hosts Portugal in the inaugural Nations League Finals in June 2019. In the semi-finals on 5 June, he scored a hat-trick against Switzerland to reach the final. Upon scoring the opening goal, he became the first player to score in 10 consecutive international competitions, breaking the record he previously shared with Ghana's Asamoah Gyan. In the final of the tournament four days later, Portugal defeated the Netherlands 1\\u20130.On 10 September 2019, Ronaldo scored four goals in a 5\\u20131 away win over Lithuania in a Euro 2020 qualifying match; in the process, he overtook Robbie Keane (23 goals) as the player with most goals in the UEFA European Championship qualifying, setting a new record with 25 goals. He also set a new record for scoring against the most national teams, 40, while also completing his eighth international hat-trick. On 14 October, he scored his 700th senior career goal for club and country from the penalty spot, in his 974th senior career appearance, a 2\\u20131 away loss to Ukraine in a Euro 2020 qualifier. On 17 November, Ronaldo scored his 99th international goal in a 2\\u20130 win over Luxembourg, leading Portugal to qualify for Euro 2020. On 8 September 2020, Ronaldo scored his 100th and 101st international goals in a 2\\u20130 away win over Sweden in a 2020\\u201321 UEFA Nations League match, becoming only the second male player ever to achieve this milestone (after Ali Daei of Iran) and the first in Europe. On 13 October, the FPF announced that Ronaldo tested positive for COVID-19 while being asymptomatic. By 30 October, Ronaldo had recovered.\\n\\n\\n=== 2021\\u2013present: All-time international appearances and top goalscorer ===\\nOn 15 June 2021, Ronaldo scored twice in Portugal's first game of Euro 2020, a 3\\u20130 win against Hungary in Budapest. This took him to a total of 11 European Championship goals, two clear of Michel Platini, as the all-time top goalscorer in the competition's history. He also became the first player to score at five Euros, and in eleven consecutive tournaments. The brace made Ronaldo the oldest player to score two goals in a match in the competition, and the oldest player to score for Portugal at a major tournament. On 23 June, he scored two penalties in Portugal's 2\\u20132 draw with France in their final group stage match, equalling Daei's record of 109 international goals. On 27 June, Portugal were eliminated following a 1\\u20130 loss against Belgium in the round of 16. Ronaldo finished the tournament with five goals (tied with Czech Patrik Schick) and one assist, earning him the Golden Boot.On 1 September, Ronaldo scored two headed goals, with his second coming seconds before the full-time whistle, in a 2\\u20131 home win against the Republic of Ireland in a World Cup qualifier at the Est\\u00e1dio Algarve, which saw him pass Ali Daei to become the sole record holder by breaking the men's international scoring record with his 110th and 111th international goals. On 9 October, he scored the opening goal in a 3\\u20130 friendly win over Qatar at the Est\\u00e1dio Algarve; with his 181st international appearance, he also overtook Sergio Ramos's record for the most international caps received by a European player. In the following match against Luxembourg on 12 October, also played at the Est\\u00e1dio Algarve, Ronaldo scored a hat-trick in a 5\\u20130 win for Portugal, and became the first player to score 10 hat-tricks in men's international football.\\nRonaldo was named in Portugal's squad for the 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar, making it his fifth World Cup. On 24 November, in Portugal's opening match against Ghana, Ronaldo scored a penalty kick and became the first male player to score in five different World Cups. In the last group game against South Korea, Ronaldo received criticism from his own coach for his reaction at being substituted. He was dropped from the starting line-up for Portugal's last 16 match against Switzerland, marking the first time since Euro 2008 that he had not started a game for Portugal in a major international tournament, and the first time Portugal had started a knockout game without Ronaldo in the starting line-up at an international tournament since Euro 2000. He came off the bench late on as Portugal won 6\\u20131, their highest tally in a World Cup knockout game since the 1966 World Cup, with Ronaldo's replacement Gon\\u00e7alo Ramos scoring a hat-trick. Portugal employed the same strategy in the quarter-finals against Morocco, with Ronaldo once again coming off the bench; in the process, he equalled Bader Al-Mutawa's international appearance record, becoming the joint\\u2013most capped male footballer of all time, with 196 caps. Portugal lost 1\\u20130, with Morocco becoming the first CAF nation ever to reach the World Cup semi-finals.Following the World Cup, despite having his future with the national team in doubt, after rumours of a possible omission by new manager Roberto Mart\\u00ednez, Ronaldo was named in Portugal's squad for the UEFA Euro 2024 qualifiers against Liechtenstein and Luxembourg. On 23 March, Ronaldo scored a brace in a 4\\u20130 win over Liechtenstein; with his 197th international appearance, he overtook Al-Mutawa's record and became the most capped male footballer of all time. On 20 June, Ronaldo made his 200th appearance for his national team, scoring the only goal of an away win over Iceland, in the Euro qualifiers, as he became the first player in the history of men's international football to make 200 appearances for his country. On 13 October, Ronaldo scored a brace in a 3\\u20132 win over Slovakia, leading Portugal to qualify for Euro 2024, marking the nation's fastest qualification to a major tournament in their history. On 16 October, Portugal secured first place in their group, following a 5\\u20130 away victory over Bosnia and Herzegovina, with Ronaldo scoring twice. The landmark goals saw him score in more than 100 goals in each of the last three decades (2000s, 2010s, 2020s).\\n\\n\\n== Player profile ==\\n\\n\\n=== Style of play ===\\nA versatile attacker, Ronaldo is capable of playing on either wing as well as through the centre of the pitch, and, while ostensibly right-footed, is very strong with both feet. Tactically, Ronaldo has undergone several evolutions throughout his career. While at Sporting and during his first season at Manchester United, he was typically deployed as a traditional winger on the right side of midfield, where he regularly looked to deliver crosses into the penalty area. In this position, he was able to use his pace and acceleration, agility and technical skills to take on opponents in one-on-one situations. Ronaldo became noted for his dribbling and flair, often displaying an array of tricks and feints, such as the step overs and so-called 'chops' that became his trademark; he has also been known to use the flip-flap.\\nHis strength and jumping ability, combined with his elevation, heading accuracy and height of 1.87 m (6 ft 1+1\\u20442 in), give him an edge in winning aerial duels. These attributes allow him to function as a target-man and make him an aerial goal threat in the penalty area; consequently, many of his goals have been headers. Allied with his increased stamina and work-rate, his goalscoring ability improved drastically on the left wing where he was given the positional freedom to move into the centre to finish attacks. He has also increasingly played a creative role for his team, often dropping deep to pick up the ball, participate in the build-up of plays and create chances for his teammates, courtesy of his vision and passing ability.In his final seasons at United, Ronaldo played an even more attacking and central role, functioning both as a striker and as a supporting forward, or even as an attacking midfielder on occasion. He developed into a prolific goalscorer, capable of finishing well both inside the penalty area and from distance with an accurate and powerful shot, courtesy of his striking ability. An accurate penalty kick taker, he also became a set piece specialist, renowned for his powerful, bending free kicks. When taking free kicks, Ronaldo is known for using the knuckleball technique, which was developed by Juninho Pernambucano. He also adopts a trademark stance before striking the ball, which involves him standing with his legs far apart. Regarding Ronaldo's unique style of taking free kicks, former United assistant manager Mike Phelan commented: \\\"People used to put the ball down, walk away, run up and hit it. He brought in a more dynamic showmanship. He places the ball down, the concentration level is high, he takes his certain amount of steps back so that his standing foot is in the perfect place to hit the ball in the sweet spot. He is the ultimate showman. He has that slight arrogance. When he pulls those shorts up and shows his thighs, he is saying 'All eyes on me' and this is going in. He understands the marketing side of it. The way he struts up and places it; the world is watching him.\\\"\\nAt Real Madrid, Ronaldo continued to play a more offensive role, while his creative and defensive duties became more limited, although not entirely diminished. Initially deployed as a centre forward by managers Manuel Pellegrini and Jos\\u00e9 Mourinho, he was later moved back onto the left wing, though in a free tactical role; this position allowed him to drift into the centre at will to get onto the end of crosses and score, or draw out defenders with his movement off the ball and leave space for teammates to exploit. Madrid's counter-attacking style of play also allowed him to become a more efficient and consistent player, as evidenced by his record-breaking goalscoring feats. While he mainly drew praise in the media for his prolific goalscoring, Ronaldo also demonstrated his ability as an effective creator in this role. This unique role has been described by pundits as that of a \\\"false\\\", \\\"attacking\\\", or \\\"goalscoring winger\\\", as Ronaldo effectively almost functioned as a striker at times with his central runs into the penalty area, despite actually playing on the left flank. From 2013 onwards, under manager Carlo Ancelotti, he effectively adapted his style to the physical effects of ageing with increasingly reduced off-the-ball movement and general involvement, completing fewer dribbles and passes per game, and instead focusing on short-distance creating and goalscoring. Since 2017, Ronaldo adapted his style of play yet again to become more of a free-roaming centre forward under manager Zinedine Zidane, a role in which he continued to excel and maintain a prolific goalscoring record; in this position, he earned praise in the media for his intelligent movement both on and off the ball, positional sense, link-up play and finishing, as well as his ability to lose or anticipate his markers, find space in the box and score from few touches or opportunities.In his first season at Juventus, Ronaldo continued to play in a variety of different attacking roles under manager Massimiliano Allegri, depending on whom he was partnered with. While he had occupied an increasingly offensive role in his final years at Real Madrid, at times he functioned in a free role at Juventus, either as a lone striker or in his trademark role on the left wing, in a 4\\u20132\\u20133\\u20131 or 4\\u20133\\u20133 formation, in which he often switched positions with Mario Mand\\u017euki\\u0107. In this role, he was also given licence to drop deep or even out wide onto the right flank to receive the ball, and be more involved in the build-up of plays; as such, aside from scoring goals himself, he began to take on opponents and create chances for other players with greater frequency than he had in his final seasons with Real Madrid. Off the ball, he was also capable of creating space for teammates with his movement and attacking runs into the box, or finishing off chances with his head or feet by getting onto the end of his teammates' crosses. On occasion he also played in an attacking partnership alongside Mand\\u017euki\\u0107 in a 4\\u20133\\u20131\\u20132, 4\\u20134\\u20132, or 3\\u20135\\u20132 formation. He continued to play a similar role in his second season with the club under manager Maurizio Sarri.\\n\\n\\n=== Image ===\\n\\nRonaldo is widely regarded as one of the two best players of his generation, alongside Lionel Messi. Winning his first Ballon d'Or in 2008 by a record-high vote count at age 23, over the next decade Ronaldo has often featured in debates concerning who is the greatest player in history. Acclaimed for his prolific and consistent goal-scoring, he is considered a decisive player who is also a game changer, especially in important and high-pressured situations.\\nRonaldo is noted for his work ethic, elite body conditioning and dedication to improvement on the training pitch, as well being regarded as a natural leader. On his longevity and \\\"extraordinary commitment to physical preparation\\\", Adam Bate of Sky Sports said: \\\"Dedication is a huge part of staying at the top and Ronaldo's focus is perhaps unparalleled within the game.\\\" While stating they were stylistically different players who shared an equal desire to score goals, former Brazil international Ronaldo praised Cristiano's approach to training, arguing that \\\"there are so few players who take care of their body like he does. I trained because I had to, he does it because he loves it.\\\" His drive and determination to succeed are fuelled by a desire to be talked about alongside other greats such as Pel\\u00e9 and Diego Maradona once retiring. He is credited, along with his compatriot, coach Jos\\u00e9 Mourinho, with inspiring changing fortunes of Portuguese football in 2010s and 2020s. At times, he has been criticised for simulating when tackled. He was also occasionally criticised early in his career by manager Alex Ferguson, teammates and the media for being a selfish or overly flamboyant player. Jonathan Wilson of The Guardian opined that Ronaldo had made Juventus, who he joined aged 33 in 2018, weaker, due to \\\"his relative immobility\\\" in his mid-30s, even if his personal goal-scoring output remained high.During his career, Ronaldo has also been described as having an \\\"arrogant image\\\" on the pitch, with Ronaldo stating that he had become a \\\"victim\\\" because of how he was portrayed in the media. He is often seen moaning, gesticulating and scowling while trying to inspire his team to victory, with Ronaldo insisting that his competitive nature should not be mistaken for arrogance. His managers, teammates and various journalists have said that this reputation has caused an unfair image of him.\\n\\n\\n=== Goal celebrations ===\\nRonaldo has adopted several goal celebrations throughout his career, including one particular celebration which gained widespread coverage in the media, when he squatted and stared directly into a camera on the sidelines of the pitch with his hand on his chin. After scoring a goal, he usually celebrates with a \\\"storming jump\\\" and \\\"turn\\\", before \\\"landing in spread-eagled fashion\\\" into his \\\"signature power stance\\\", while usually simultaneously exclaiming \\\"S\\u00ed\\\" (Spanish and Italian for \\\"yes\\\"). This trademark celebration has been dubbed the \\\"Siu\\\" in the media.\\n\\n\\n=== Rivalry with Lionel Messi ===\\n\\nBoth Ronaldo and Lionel Messi have scored in multiple UEFA Champions League finals and have regularly broken the 50-goal barrier in a single season. Sports journalists and pundits regularly weigh the individual merits of both players in an attempt to argue who they believe is the best player in modern football or in the history of the game. It has been compared to several sports rivalries, among them the Muhammad Ali\\u2013Joe Frazier rivalry in boxing, the Borg\\u2013McEnroe rivalry in tennis and the Senna\\u2013Prost rivalry from Formula One motor racing. Some commentators choose to analyse the differing physiques and playing styles of the two. Part of the debate revolves around the contrasting personalities of the two players, as Ronaldo is sometimes depicted as an arrogant and theatrical showoff, while Messi is portrayed as a shy, humble character.\\n\\nIn a 2012 interview, Ronaldo commented on the rivalry, saying: \\\"I think we push each other sometimes in the competition, this is why the competition is so high.\\\" Alex Ferguson, Ronaldo's manager during his time at Manchester United, opined: \\\"I don't think the rivalry against each other bothers them. I think they have their own personal pride in terms of wanting to be the best.\\\" Messi himself denied any rivalry, saying that it was \\\"only the media, the press, who wants us to be at loggerheads but I've never fought with Cristiano.\\\" Responding to the claims that he and Messi do not get on well on a personal level, Ronaldo commented: \\\"We don't have a relationship outside the world of football, just as we don't with a lot of other players.\\\" Ronaldo added that in years to come he hopes they can laugh about it together, stating: \\\"We have to look on this rivalry with a positive spirit, because it's a good thing.\\\" Representing archrivals Barcelona and Real Madrid, the two players faced each other at least twice every season in the world's biggest club game, El Cl\\u00e1sico, which is among the world's most viewed annual sporting events.In a debate at Oxford Union in October 2013, when asked whether FIFA president Sepp Blatter preferred Messi or Ronaldo, Blatter paid tribute to the work ethic of the Argentine before taking a swipe at Ronaldo, claiming \\\"one of them has more expenses for the hairdresser than the other.\\\" Real Madrid demanded and promptly received a full apology. In response to Blatter's \\\"commander\\\" on the pitch comment, Ronaldo issued his own riposte with a mock-salute celebration after scoring a penalty against Sevilla. In August 2019, Ronaldo and Messi were interviewed while sat next to each other prior to the announcement of the UEFA Men's Player of the Year, with Ronaldo stating: \\\"I pushed him and he pushed me as well. So it's good to be part of the history of football.\\\"In September 2023, Ronaldo declared that his rivalry with Messi was over and \\\"gone\\\", after 36 official fixtures and 15 years of \\\"sharing the stage\\\". After Messi led Argentina to victory in the 2022 FIFA World Cup, a number of football critics, commentators and players have opined that Messi has settled the debate between the two players.\\n\\n\\n== Outside football ==\\n\\nSince his reputation grew at Manchester United, Ronaldo has signed many sponsorship deals for consumer products, including sportswear, football boots; since November 2012, Ronaldo has worn the Nike Mercurial Vapor personalised CR7 edition, soft drinks, clothing, automotive lubricants, financial services, electronics, and video games. Ronaldo featured as the cover star of FIFA video game FIFA 18 and was heavily involved in the game's promotion. His \\\"Sii\\\" goal celebration features in the FIFA series, accompanied with his own voiceover. He was also the face of Pro Evolution Soccer, appearing on the covers of the 2008, 2012 and 2013 editions of the game.With earnings of \\u20ac720 million (\\u00a3615 million) from 2010 to 2019, Ronaldo was ranked second in Forbes list of the decade's highest-paid athletes, behind boxer Floyd Mayweather Jr. Forbes twice ranked Ronaldo first on its list of the world's highest-paid football players; his combined income from salaries, bonuses and endorsements was $73 million in 2013\\u201314 and $79 million in 2014\\u201315. The latter earnings saw him listed behind only Mayweather on the magazine's list of The World's Highest-Paid Athletes. In 2016, he became the first footballer to top the Forbes list of highest-earning athletes, with a total income of $88 million from his salary and endorsements in 2015\\u201316. He topped the list for the second straight year with earnings of $93 million in 2016\\u201317. He is the first footballer and only the third sportsman to earn $1 billion in their career. Ronaldo is one of the world's most marketable sportsmen: SportsPro rated him the fifth most marketable athlete in 2012 and eighth most marketable athlete in 2013. Sports market research company Repucom named Ronaldo the most marketable and most recognised football player in the world in May 2014. He was additionally named in the 2014 Time 100, Time's annual list of the most influential people in the world. ESPN named Ronaldo the world's most famous athlete in 2016, 2017, 2018 and 2019.\\nRonaldo has established a strong online presence. The most popular sportsperson on social media, he counted over 500 million total followers across Facebook, Twitter and Instagram by February 2021, making him the first person to pass half a billion followers. The most-followed person on Facebook (168 million), most-followed on Instagram (615 million) and most-followed sportsperson on Twitter (109 million), his sponsors earned $936 million in media value across his accounts between June 2016 and June 2017. In December 2011, he launched an iPhone game called Heads Up with Cristiano, created by developer RockLive, and in December 2013, he launched Viva Ronaldo, a dedicated social networking website and app. Computer security company McAfee produced a 2012 report ranking footballers by the probability of an internet search for their name leading to an unsafe website, with Ronaldo's name first on the list.Ronaldo's autobiography, titled Moments, was published in 2007. His sponsor Castrol produced the television film Ronaldo: Tested to the Limit, in which he was physically and mentally tested in several areas; his physical performance was subject to scrutiny by world media upon the film's release in September 2011. Cristiano Ronaldo: The World at His Feet, a documentary narrated by actor Benedict Cumberbatch, was released via Vimeo in June 2014. A documentary film directed by Anthony Wonke about his life and career, titled Ronaldo, was released on 9 November 2015.\\nDemand for a replica Ronaldo shirt has been high throughout his career. In 2008, Ronaldo's number 7 Manchester United shirt was the best-selling Premier League sports product. In 2015, Ronaldo's number 7 Real Madrid shirt was the second best-selling worldwide, after Messi's number 10 Barcelona shirt. In 2018, within 24 hours of his number 7 Juventus shirt being released, over 520,000 had been sold, with $62.4 million generated in one day.Ronaldo opened a fashion boutique under the name CR7 (his initials and shirt number) on the island of Madeira in 2006 and opened a second in Lisbon in 2008. In partnership with Scandinavian manufacturer JBS Textile Group and the New York fashion designer Richard Chai, Ronaldo co-designed a range of underwear and sock line, released in November 2013. He expanded his CR7 fashion brand by launching a line of premium shirts and shoes in July 2014. In September 2015, Ronaldo released his own fragrance, \\\"Legacy\\\", in a partnership with Eden Parfums.\\nIn 2007, C.D. Nacional renamed its youth campus Cristiano Ronaldo Campus Futebol (Cristiano Ronaldo Football Campus). In December 2013, Ronaldo opened a museum, Museu CR7, in his hometown of Funchal, Madeira, to house trophies and memorabilia; the museum is an official sponsor of the local football team Uni\\u00e3o da Madeira. At a ceremony held at the Bel\\u00e9m Palace in January 2014, President of Portugal An\\u00edbal Cavaco Silva raised Ronaldo to the rank of Grand Officer of the Order of Prince Henry \\\"to distinguish an athlete of world renown who has been a symbol of Portugal globally, contributing to the international projection of the country and setting an example of tenacity for future generations.\\\" A bronze statue of Ronaldo, designed by artist Ricardo Madeira Veloso, was unveiled in Funchal on 21 December 2014.\\nIn June 2010, during the build-up to the World Cup, Ronaldo became the fourth footballer (after Steven Gerrard, Pel\\u00e9, and David Beckham) to be represented as a waxwork at Madame Tussauds London. Another waxwork of him was presented at the Madrid Wax Museum in December 2013. In June 2015, astronomers led by David Sobral from Lisbon and Leiden discovered a galaxy which they named Cosmos Redshift 7 (CR7) in tribute to Ronaldo.On 23 July 2016, following Portugal's triumph at Euro 2016, Madeira Airport in Funchal was renamed as Cristiano Ronaldo International Airport. The unveiling of the rebranded terminal took place on 29 March 2017, which included a bust of his head being presented. The bust and the name change were controversial, with the lack of the bust's likeness to Ronaldo being ridiculed by comedians, including Saturday Night Live, while the name change was subject to much debate locally by some politicians and citizens, who even started a petition against the move, an action criticised by President of Madeira Miguel Albuquerque. A year later, sports website Bleacher Report commissioned sculptor Emanuel Santos to create another bust; however, this bust was never used and a new one was made by a Spanish sculptor, shown to the public on 15 June 2018.On 21 September 2020, the Sporting CP's football academy in Alcochete, until then called Academia Sporting, was renamed Academia Cristiano Ronaldo.Since October 26, 2023, the new owners of Medialivre (Correio da Manh\\u00e3, Record and Jornal de Neg\\u00f3cios publisher) are a group of investors that include Cristiano Ronaldo through Portuguese company Express\\u00e3o Livre.In 2023, the Lisbon City Council approved awarding him, at the proposal of its president, Carlos Moedas, the Medal of Honor of the City, because he is \\\"a great Lisboner, in the sense of the passion he has for the city\\\".\\n\\n\\n=== Philanthropy ===\\nRonaldo has made contributions to various charitable causes throughout his career. Television footage of the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami showed an eight-year-old boy survivor named Martunis wearing a Portuguese football shirt who was stranded for 19 days after his family was killed. Following this, Ronaldo visited Aceh, Indonesia, to raise funds for rehabilitation and reconstruction. After accepting undisclosed damages from a libel case against The Sun newspaper in 2008, Ronaldo donated the damages to a charity in Madeira. In 2009, Ronaldo donated \\u00a3100,000 to the hospital that saved his mother's life in Madeira following her battle with cancer, so that they could build a cancer centre on the island. In support of the victims of the 2010 Madeira flood, Ronaldo pledged to play in a charity match in Madeira between Primeira Liga club Porto and players from Madeiran-based clubs Mar\\u00edtimo and Nacional.In 2012, Ronaldo and his agent paid for specialist treatment for a nine-year-old Canarian boy with apparently terminal cancer. In December 2012, Ronaldo joined FIFA's \\\"11 for Health\\\" programme to raise awareness amongst kids of how to steer clear of conditions including drug addiction, HIV, malaria, and obesity. In January 2013, Ronaldo became Save the Children's new Global Artist Ambassador, in which he hopes to help fight child hunger and obesity. In March 2013, Ronaldo agreed to be the ambassador for The Mangrove Care Forum in Indonesia, an organisation aiming to raise awareness of mangrove conservation.Ronaldo was named the world's most charitable sportsperson in 2015 after donating \\u00a35 million to the relief effort after the earthquake in Nepal which killed over 8,000 people. In June 2016, Ronaldo donated the entirety of his \\u20ac600,000 Champions League bonus after Real Madrid won the competition. In August, Ronaldo launched CR7Selfie, a selfie app for charity to help Save the Children that lets participants take a selfie with him in one of several different outfits and poses.\\n\\n\\n== Personal life ==\\n\\n\\n=== Family, children, and relationships ===\\nRonaldo has five living children. He first became a father to a son, who was born on 17 June 2010 in the United States. He has full custody of the child and has not publicly revealed the identity of the mother per an agreement with her. In January 2015, Ronaldo's five-year relationship with Russian model Irina Shayk ended.Ronaldo became a father to twins, born on 8 June 2017 in the United States via surrogacy. He is currently in a relationship with Argentine-born Spanish model Georgina Rodr\\u00edguez, who gave birth to a daughter on 12 November 2017. The couple expected a pair of twins in 2022. The male twin died during childbirth while the female twin survived.Ronaldo's father, Jos\\u00e9, died of an alcoholism-related liver condition at age 52 in September 2005 when Ronaldo was 20.In January 2023, after Ronaldo moved to Saudi Arabia with his family having been signed by Saudi Pro League side Al Nassr, the rulers of the Muslim-leaning Kingdom made Ronaldo an exception to the rule that unmarried couples are not allowed to live together in Saudi Arabia. An unnamed Saudi lawyer told Spanish news agency EFE that \\\"the laws of the Kingdom still prohibit cohabitation without a marriage contract\\\", but Saudi authorities have begun to \\\"turn a blind eye and stop prosecuting anyone, even though these laws are applied when there is a problem or a crime\\\".Ronaldo is of Cape Verdean descent through his great-grandmother. He is a Roman Catholic.\\n\\n\\n=== Health ===\\nRonaldo has said that he does not drink alcohol, and he received libel damages over a Daily Mirror article that reported him drinking heavily in a nightclub while recovering from an injury in July 2008. He also does not have any tattoos as he regularly donates blood and bone marrow.\\n\\n\\n=== Legal issues ===\\nIn July 2017, Ronaldo was charged with fraudulently evading almost \\u20ac15 million in tax between 2011 and 2014, a claim he denied at the time. In June 2018, Ronaldo was given a two-year suspended jail sentence and fined \\u20ac18.8 million, later reduced to \\u20ac16.8 million after reaching a deal with Spanish authorities. The sentence can be served under probation, without any jail time, so long as he does not re-offend.Ronaldo and another man were investigated by the British Crown Prosecution Service after a 2005 rape allegation was brought forward by two women. Within days, the two women withdrew their allegation and Scotland Yard later issued a statement declaring there was not enough evidence for a prosecution.In April 2017, it was reported that Ronaldo was being investigated by the Las Vegas Police Department for an allegation by a woman that he had raped her in 2009. Documents, confirmed by Ronaldo's lawyers, state that Ronaldo paid a woman US$375,000 in a non-disclosure settlement. Ronaldo and his lawyers issued a lengthy statement denying all accusations, describing them as an \\\"intentional defamation campaign\\\" with parts significantly \\\"altered and/or completely fabricated\\\", a claim which Der Spiegel categorically denied. In July 2019, Las Vegas prosecutors said they would not charge Ronaldo over allegations of rape; the statement added: \\\"Based upon a review of information at this time, the allegations of sexual assault against Cristiano Ronaldo cannot be proven beyond a reasonable doubt.\\\" The same woman, in September 2018, filed a civil lawsuit in Nevada accusing Ronaldo of rape. The Daily Mirror, citing court documents, reported in 2021 that the woman sought \\u00a356 million in damages from Ronaldo. In October 2021, federal magistrate judge Daniel Albregts recommended that the lawsuit be dismissed, citing that the woman's lawyer, Leslie Stovall, \\\"acted in bad faith by asking for, receiving, and using Football Leaks documents to prosecute\\\" the case, despite the documents containing \\\"privileged communications\\\" between Ronaldo and his lawyers. Additionally, Albregts stated that no evidence was found of Ronaldo's lawyers having \\\"intimidated [the woman] or impeded law enforcement\\\" during the 2010 settlement with her. In June 2022, the woman's rape lawsuit was dismissed with prejudice in the United States District Court for the District of Nevada, as district judge Jennifer A. Dorsey ruled that Stovall's repeated use of \\\"cyber-hacked attorney\\u2013client privileged documents\\\" were actions representing \\\"abuses and flagrant circumvention of the proper litigation process\\\".\\n\\n\\n== Career statistics ==\\n\\n\\n=== Club ===\\nAs of match played 15 March 2024\\n\\n\\n=== International ===\\n\\nAs of match played 19 November 2023Notes\\n\\n\\n== Honours ==\\n\\nSporting CP\\nSuperta\\u00e7a C\\u00e2ndido de Oliveira: 2002Manchester United\\nPremier League: 2006\\u201307, 2007\\u201308, 2008\\u201309\\nFA Cup: 2003\\u201304\\nFootball League Cup: 2005\\u201306, 2008\\u201309\\nFA Community Shield: 2007\\nUEFA Champions League: 2007\\u201308\\nFIFA Club World Cup: 2008Real Madrid\\nLa Liga: 2011\\u201312, 2016\\u201317\\nCopa del Rey: 2010\\u201311, 2013\\u201314\\nSupercopa de Espa\\u00f1a: 2012, 2017\\nUEFA Champions League: 2013\\u201314, 2015\\u201316, 2016\\u201317, 2017\\u201318\\nUEFA Super Cup: 2014, 2017\\nFIFA Club World Cup: 2014, 2016, 2017Juventus\\nSerie A: 2018\\u201319, 2019\\u201320\\nCoppa Italia: 2020\\u201321\\nSupercoppa Italiana: 2018, 2020Al Nassr\\n\\nArab Club Champions Cup: 2023Portugal\\n\\nUEFA European Championship: 2016\\nUEFA Nations League: 2018\\u201319Individual\\n\\nBallon d'Or/FIFA Ballon d'Or: 2008, 2013, 2014, 2016, 2017\\nFIFA World Player of the Year: 2008\\nThe Best FIFA Men's Player: 2016, 2017\\nThe Best FIFA Special Award for Outstanding Career Achievement: 2021\\nUEFA Club Footballer of the Year: 2007\\u201308\\nUEFA Men's Player of the Year Award: 2013\\u201314, 2015\\u201316, 2016\\u201317\\nEuropean Golden Shoe: 2007\\u201308, 2010\\u201311, 2013\\u201314, 2014\\u201315\\nGolden Foot: 2020\\nFIFA Pusk\\u00e1s Award: 2009\\nFIFA Club World Cup Golden Ball: 2016\\nUEFA European Championship Golden Boot: 2020\\nUEFA Champions League top scorer: 2007\\u201308, 2012\\u201313, 2013\\u201314, 2014\\u201315, 2015\\u201316, 2016\\u201317, 2017\\u201318\\nPremier League Player of the Season: 2006\\u201307, 2007\\u201308\\nLa Liga Best Player: 2013\\u201314\\nSerie A Footballer of the Year: 2019, 2020\\nPremier League Golden Boot: 2007\\u201308\\nPichichi Trophy: 2010\\u201311, 2013\\u201314, 2014\\u201315\\nCapocannoniere: 2020\\u201321\\nPortuguese Sportsman of the Year: 2011, 2012, 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019\\nFPF Portuguese Player of the Year: 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019, 2022Orders\\n\\n Medal of Merit, Order of the Immaculate Conception of Vila Vi\\u00e7osa (Portuguese Royal Family)\\n Grand officer of the Order of Prince Henry\\n Commander of the Order of Merit\\nCord\\u00e3o Auton\\u00f3mico de Distin\\u00e7\\u00e3o\\n\\n\\n== See also ==\\nList of footballers with 100 or more UEFA Champions League appearances\\nList of top international men's football goal scorers by country\\nList of men's footballers with 100 or more international caps\\nList of men's footballers with 50 or more international goals\\nList of men's footballers with the most official appearances\\nList of men's footballers with 500 or more goals\\n\\n\\n== Notes ==\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n\\n\\n=== Citations ===\\n\\n\\n=== Works cited ===\\nCaioli, Luca (2016) [2012].

She is currently ranked  as the world No. 1 in women\\'s singles by the Women\\'s Tennis Association (WTA), having held the position for a total of 95 weeks. Świątek is a four-time major singles champion, having won the French Open in 2020, 2022, and 2023 and the US Open in 2022. She is the first player representing Poland to win a major singles title. She has won a total of 19 singles titles, including the 2023 WTA Finals.\\nŚwiątek\\'s father, Tomasz, is a retired Olympic rower. As a junior, Świątek was the 2018 French Open girls\\' doubles champion alongside Caty McNally and the 2018 Wimbledon girls\\' singles champion. Świątek began playing regularly on the WTA Tour in 2019, and entered the top 50 at 18 years old after her first Tour final and a fourth-round appearance at the 2019 French Open.\\nDuring her French Open title run in 2020, Świątek did not lose more than five games in any singles match. She entered the top ten of the WTA rankings for the first time in May 2021 after winning the Italian Open. Following back-to-back WTA 1000 titles in 2022 at Qatar and Indian Wells, Świątek reached a career-high ranking of No. 2. After the retirement of world No. 1 Ashleigh Barty, she became the first Polish player, male or female, to reach the top ranking in singles, on 4 April 2022. During this time, Świątek accumulated a 37-match winning streak, the longest on the WTA Tour in the 21st century. With major titles at the French and US Opens, she finished 2022 as the dominant No. 1. In 2023 she defended her French Open title and claimed the WTA Finals to finish as year-end No. 1 again.\\nŚwiątek has an all-court playing style. She won the WTA Fan Favorite Shot of the Year in 2019 with a drop shot from the baseline, and was voted WTA Fan Favorite Singles Player of the Year in 2020. In 2023, she was named the L\\'Équipe Champion of Champions and Polish Sports Personality of the Year and included on Time\\'s annual list of the 100 most influential people in the world.\\n\\n\\n== Early life and background ==\\nIga Świątek was born on 31 May 2001 in Warsaw to Dorota and Tomasz Świątek. Her father is a former rower who competed in the men\\'s quadruple sculls event at the 1988 Seoul Olympics. Her mother is an orthodontist. She has a sister, Agata, who is about three years older and is a dentist.Świątek\\'s father wanted his daughters to become competitive athletes and preferred they take up an individual sport rather than a team sport to have better control of their chances of success. Agata initially started out as a swimmer but switched to tennis after she had issues with swimming. Iga followed her sister into tennis because she wanted to beat her and also because she wanted to be more like her. Agata briefly competed on the ITF Junior Circuit in 2013 at about 15 years old, but stopped playing due to injury troubles. Iga trained at Mera Warsaw as a 14-year-old before later moving to Legia Warsaw.\\n\\n\\n== Junior career ==\\nŚwiątek reached a career-high ranking of No. 5 as a junior. She began competing in ITF Junior Circuit events in 2015 and won back-to-back low-level Grade 4 titles in April and May at age 13. Before the end of the year, she moved up to Grade 2 events and finished runner-up in both singles and doubles at the Czech Junior Open. Świątek made her junior Grand Slam debut in 2016 at the French Open, reaching the quarterfinals in both singles and doubles. She followed this up with her best junior title to date at the Grade 1 Canadian Open Junior Championships, defeating Olga Danilović in the final.Świątek had a strong first half of 2017. She won both the singles and doubles titles at the Grade 1 Traralgon Junior International. Although she lost her opening round match at the Australian Open, she partnered with compatriot Maja Chwalińska to make her first final in a Grand Slam event, finishing runner-up in doubles to the North American team of Bianca Andreescu and Carson Branstine. She then reached her first Grade A singles final at the Trofeo Bonfiglio, losing to Elena Rybakina. Her season came to an end after another quarterfinal at the French Open, after which she had right ankle surgery that kept her out for seven months.Despite only competing in two Grand Slam tournaments in 2018 and three singles events in total, Świątek finished her junior career with her best season. She returned to the junior tour at the French Open after a one-year absence and reached the semi-finals in singles, losing to Caty McNally. She fared better in doubles, partnering with McNally to win her first junior Grand Slam title. They defeated the Japanese team of Yuki Naito and Naho Sato in the final.Świątek played only singles at Wimbledon. As an unseeded player due to her absence, she was drawn against top seed Whitney Osuigwe in the first round. After winning that match in three sets, she did not drop another set during the rest of the tournament and won the championship for her only junior Grand Slam singles title. She defeated Leonie Küng in the final.\\nŚwiątek then teamed up with the Slovenian Kaja Juvan to compete in the 2018 Summer Youth Olympics. They reached the final and defeated the Japanese team of Yuki Naito and Naho Sato. She then finished her junior career.\\n\\n\\n== Professional career ==\\n\\n\\n=== 2016–2018: Undefeated in seven ITF Circuit finals ===\\nŚwiątek began competing on the ITF Women\\'s Circuit in 2016 and played on the circuit through the end of 2018. She won all seven ITF singles finals she reached, ranging from the first four at the $10k to $15k level to one at the $25k level followed up by two at the $60k level. Her first three titles came at 15 years old. The fourth was in February 2018 in her first tournament back from a seven-month layoff due to injury. After a $25k title in April, Świątek moved up to higher-level ITF events later that month. Following her junior Wimbledon title in July, she skipped the junior US Open to stay in Europe. During the two weeks of the US Open, she won back-to-back $60k titles at the NEK Ladies Open in Hungary and the Montreux Ladies Open in Switzerland. During the second event, she defeated top seed and world No. 120, Mariana Duque-Mariño. These were Świątek\\'s last two ITF tournaments of the year. With these two titles, she entered the top 200 for the first time at the age of 17, rising from No. 298 to No. 180 in those two weeks.\\n\\n\\n=== 2019: First WTA Tour final, top 50 debut ===\\nDespite never playing on the WTA Tour before 2019, Świątek was able to compete in only tour-level events throughout the year. After failing to qualify at the Auckland Open, she qualified for her first major main draw at the Australian Open. She then defeated No. 82 Ana Bogdan, in three sets, in her debut match to reach the second round. At her next three tournaments, she also qualified at the Hungarian Ladies Open, but not either of the Premier Mandatory events in March.Świątek made her first WTA breakthrough at the Ladies Open Lugano in April. With her first direct acceptance into a main draw, she made her first WTA final. During the event, she upset No. 3 seed Viktória Kužmová in the second round for her first top 50 victory. She ultimately finished runner-up to Polona Hercog in three sets. Moreover, a precise cross-court forehand drop shot she hit against Kristýna Plíšková in the semi-final was voted the 2019 WTA Shot of the Year. With the runner-up, she also made her debut in the top 100 while still 17 years old. Świątek closed out her clay court season with a fourth round appearance at the French Open in her second major. She upset No. 16 Wang Qiang in the second round for her first top 20 victory before losing to defending champion Simona Halep.Świątek could not repeat her French Open success at the remaining Grand Slam events of the year, losing her opening match at Wimbledon and in the second round at the US Open. Her best result in the second half of the season was a third round appearance at the Canadian Open. During the event, she upset No. 18, Caroline Wozniacki, before losing to No. 2, Naomi Osaka. With this result, she entered the top 50 for the first time a week later. She missed the rest of the season after the US Open to undergo foot surgery and finished the year at No. 61 in the world.\\n\\n\\n=== 2020: First French Open title, top 20 debut ===\\n\\nŚwiątek made her return to the WTA Tour at the Australian Open. She matched her best result at a Grand Slam tournament with another fourth-round appearance, this time highlighted by a victory over No. 20, Donna Vekić. She defeated Vekić again at the Qatar Open, her last match win before the WTA Tour was shut down for six months due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Świątek continued her Grand Slam success once the tour resumed. She reached the third round at the US Open, losing to eventual runner-up Victoria Azarenka.Entering the rescheduled French Open in September, Świątek was ranked No. 54 in the world. Nonetheless, she won the singles event for her maiden WTA title. During the tournament, she defeated 2019 runner-up and world No. 19, Markéta Vondroušová, in the opening round. Her biggest upset was a victory in the fourth round over top seed and world No. 2, Simona Halep, who was on a 17-match win streak and was also the heavy favourite to win the title. She only lost three games against Halep after winning just one game against her in the same round of the French Open the previous year. Świątek defeated world No. 6, Sofia Kenin, in the final to become the first Polish player to win a Grand Slam singles title and the lowest-ranked French Open champion in the history of the WTA rankings. She also became the youngest singles champion at the tournament since Rafael Nadal in 2005 and the youngest women\\'s singles winner since Monica Seles in 1992. She won the title without dropping a set or more than five games to any opponent, and the 28 games she lost in total were tied for the second-fewest among French Open singles champions in the Open Era behind only the 20 games Steffi Graf lost in 1988. With the title, Świątek rose to No. 17 in the world. She also played the doubles event, partnering with Nicole Melichar for the first time. The pair reached the semi-finals, and also did not drop a set until their last match.\\n\\n\\n=== 2021: WTA 1000 title, top 10 debut ===\\n\\nAt the Australian Open, Świątek was seeded 15th and recorded wins over Arantxa Rus, Camila Giorgi and Fiona Ferro. She reached the fourth round where she lost to Simona Halep, in three sets. At Adelaide, she won her first WTA Tour title without dropping a set in the whole tournament. She defeated Belinda Bencic in the final, in straight sets. As a result, she entered the top 15 for the first time in her career, in March 2021.Seeded 15th, Świątek won her first career WTA 1000-title at the Italian Open, defeating former champion Karolína Plíšková in just 46 minutes without the loss of a single game. She advanced to the final after defeating two-time champion and world No. 5, Elina Svitolina, and the second best-ranked teenager Coco Gauff on the same day, as well as saving match points in her third-round match against Barbora Krejčíková. Świątek became the third player to win a title after saving match point en route in 2021, alongside Naomi Osaka at the Australian Open and Ashleigh Barty in Miami. She also became the fourth teenager to win a WTA 1000 event. This successful run to her third career title moved her into the top 10 in the singles rankings on 17 May 2021, as world No. 9.At the French Open, Świątek was seeded at No. 8. She opened her title defense winning against Kaja Juvan in the first round, and then defeated Rebecca Peterson, Anett Kontaveit and Marta Kostyuk. She won 22 straight sets at the French Open but then lost in the quarterfinals to Maria Sakkari. In doubles, seeded 14th with Bethanie Mattek-Sands as a pair, playing just their third event together, they reached the final where they were defeated by Barbora Krejčíková and Kateřina Siniaková in straight sets. As a result, Świątek reached the top 50 at a career-high ranking of No. 42 in doubles for the first time in her career.She started her grass-court season at the Eastbourne International where she was seeded at No. 4. After defeating Heather Watson, she lost to Daria Kasatkina in the second round. As the seventh seed at Wimbledon, Świątek defeated Hsieh Su-wei, Vera Zvonareva, and Irina-Camelia Begu, all in straight sets. In the fourth round, she lost to Ons Jabeur, in three sets. With her win over Anett Kontaveit in the third round of the US Open, she became the only player to have reached the second week of all four Grand Slam championships in the 2021 season. She qualified for the WTA Finals for the first time in her career.\\n\\n\\n=== 2022: World No. 1, two major titles, 37-match winning streak ===\\n\\nŚwiątek started her season by reaching the semi-finals at the Adelaide International. She then reached another semi-finals at the Australian Open. Following a second-round match loss against Jeļena Ostapenko, Świątek won the next six tournaments she entered — Qatar Ladies Open, Indian Wells Open, Miami Open, Stuttgart Open, Italian Open and, for her second major title, French Open — before losing to Alizé Cornet at Wimbledon in the third round. Świątek reached the world No. 1 singles ranking, and became the fourth as well as the youngest woman (11th player overall) to complete the Sunshine Double in the process. She also accumulated a 37-match win streak, the longest in the 21st century. Świątek had a lacklustre performance throughout the summer. She lost to Caroline Garcia in the quarterfinals in Warsaw, Beatriz Haddad Maia in the third round in Toronto and Madison Keys in the third round in Cincinnati. However, she returned on form at the US Open, winning her third major by defeating Ons Jabeur in the final. She became the first woman to win both the French Open and US Open in the same season since Serena Williams in 2013.Świątek reached the final at the Ostrava Open, but she lost to Barbora Krejčíková in a three-set match that lasted 3 hours and 16 minutes, the longest match of her career so far. She subsequently played at the San Diego Open, winning her eighth title by defeating Donna Vekić, in three sets. At the 2022 WTA Finals held in Fort Worth, Texas, Świątek won the group stage without dropping a set, defeating Daria Kasatkina, Caroline Garcia and Coco Gauff, respectively. However, she was upset by Aryna Sabalenka in the semi-finals in three sets. Nevertheless, she finished the season as year-end No. 1 and posted a record win-loss 67–9 in 2022, the most wins in a single season since Serena Williams in 2013. She also became the first player since Serena Williams in 2013 to collect over 11,000 ranking points in a single season. She collected the second highest ranking points total in WTA history, second only to Serena Williams in 2013.\\n\\n\\n=== 2023: French Open and WTA finals champion, year-end No. 1 ===\\n\\nŚwiątek\\'s 2023 campaign was statistically less dominant than her 2022 season, but she still managed to win six titles in the year. She started 2023 as only the fourth woman in WTA history to be ranked world No. 1 for 40 or more consecutive weeks in their first stint as the top-ranked player. In her first tournament of the year representing Poland at the United Cup, she partnered with her compatriots including Hubert Hurkacz and reached the semi-finals. At the Australian Open, she lost in the fourth round in straight sets against Elena Rybakina, who would upset Świątek two more times later in the year, respectively in the semi-finals at the Indian Wells Open and in the quarterfinals at the Italian Open.\\nShe did not win any tournament until the Qatar Ladies Open, where she did not drop a set throughout the tournament and only lost five games. The clay season saw her successfully defend her Stuttgart Open title, as well as winning her fourth Grand Slam at the French Open by defeating Karolína Muchová in the final. After improvement on the grass court with a quarterfinal performance at Wimbledon, which ended her 14-match win streak, she won her home tournament at the Poland Open.At the US Open, Świątek lost in round four against Jelena Ostapenko, which ended her reign at world No. 1. Her 75-week reign at No. 1 is the third-longest streak in the Open Era among players in their first stint as the top player, behind only Steffi Graf and Martina Hingis. Nevertheless, she went on to win the China Open. At the WTA Finals, she won the title without dropping a set, becoming the first player to do so since Serena Williams in 2012. She also dropped just 20 games throughout the entire tournament, the fewest since the reintroduction of the round-robin format in 2003 and beat Serena Williams\\'s record of 32 overall games dropped. She also beat the record for games lost in a final, which previously held by Martina Navratilova in 1983 and Kim Clijsters in 2003 (two each). Świątek lost only one game in the final. By winning the title, she reclaimed the top ranking and became the year-end No. 1 for the second season in a row.\\n\\n\\n=== 2024: United Cup finalist, 2nd Indian Wells title ===\\n\\nŚwiątek entered the United Cup in an international team competition representing Team Poland. She reached the final winning all of her singles matches and received the MVP award of the event. In the third round of the Australian Open, she was upset by Linda Nosková in three sets and as a result of this loss her 18 match winning streak came to an end which started in September 2023. Despite this earlier loss she kept her World No. 1 ranking. \\nIn February, Świątek entered the Qatar Open as a two-time defending champion. She reached the final after having defeated Sorana Cîrstea, 14th seed Ekaterina Alexandrova and Viktoria Azarenka. In the final, she faced Elena Rybakina winning in straight sets and claiming her 7th WTA 1000 title. Świątek did not drop a set en route to the title for the second consecutive year. She also became the first person to win three consecutive titles in Doha and the first player to win three consecutive titles at the same hardcourt tournament since Serena Williams in 2015. At the next WTA 1000 tournament in Dubai, she reached back-to-back quarterfinals defeating 15th seed Elina Svitolina in the round of 16. She was the fourth player since the WTA-1000 format\\'s introduction in 2009 the make the quarterfinals in 9+ consecutive appearances (between Dubai 2023 – Dubai 2024) after Serena Williams, Maria Sharapova and Agnieszka Radwanska. She then advanced to the semifinals where she lost to Anna Kalinskaya in straight sets.In March, Świątek won Indian Wells for the second time, defeating Maria Sakkari in the final. This was her second title of the season and 19th overall.\\n\\n\\n== National representation ==\\n\\n\\n=== Junior competitions ===\\nŚwiątek represented Poland at the ITF World Junior Tennis Finals for 14-and-under girls twice in 2014 and 2015. She won all of her matches in 2014 to lead Poland to a ninth-place finish out of 16 teams. The following year, she helped Poland go undefeated in the round robin stage to reach the semi-finals. Świątek moved up to the 16-and-under Junior Fed Cup in 2016, where she played alongside Maja Chwalińska and Stefania Rogozińska-Dzik. Poland won the title, defeating the United States 2–1 in the final. Świątek won both of her rubbers in the final tie, defeating Amanda Anisimova in singles before partnering with Chwalińska to defeat Caty McNally and Claire Liu in the decisive doubles rubber. The last event of Świątek\\'s junior career was the 2018 Summer Youth Olympic Games. Although she lost in the quarterfinals in singles to Clara Burel, she partnered with Slovenian Kaja Juvan to win the gold medal in doubles. In the final they defeated Naito and Sato, who were also Świątek\\'s opponents in the French Open doubles final earlier in the year.\\n\\n\\n=== Billie Jean King Cup ===\\nŚwiątek made her senior Billie Jean King Cup debut in 2018 when Poland was in Europe/Africa Zone Group I. To advance out of this group, Poland needed to win their round-robin group, a play-off tie against one of the other round robin group winners, and then another play-off tie as part of the separate World Group II Play-off round. They did not win their round-robin group in 2018 or 2019. Świątek won her only singles match in 2018. While she only won one of her three singles matches in 2019, she won both of her doubles rubbers while partnering with Alicja Rosolska. The following year, the format was changed so that Poland only needed to finish in the top two out of three teams in their round-robin group to reach the promotional play-off. Nonetheless, they won their group and defeated Sweden 2–0 in the play-off to advance to the separate Play-off round. Świątek won all three of her singles matches in the 2020 Europe/Africa Zone Group I round, before skipping the Play-offs themselves. The following edition in 2022 had Poland facing Romania in the qualifying round, with Świątek winning her two games to help the team move on to the  Finals. However, she did not attend the finals because the decisive round started very soon after the 2022 WTA Finals. The rib injury Świątek encountered shortly after exiting the 2023 Indian Wells Open also caused her to miss Poland\\'s 2023 Billie Jean King cup qualifier against Kazakhstan in Astana. Overall, Świątek has a 9–3 record at the Fed Cup, comprising 7–2 in singles and 2–1 in doubles.\\n\\n\\n== Playing style ==\\nŚwiątek has an aggressive, all-court style of play and incorporates a lot of variety into her game. Because her game style is focused on offence, she typically generates high amounts of both winners and unforced errors. She has described her style of play on clay as \"a big serve, topspin, and backhand down the line\". Despite her aggressive style of play, she plays with margin, and constructs points carefully until she creates an opportunity to hit a winner, and in all seven of her matches played at the 2020 French Open, she hit more winners than unforced errors. In total at the French Open that year, she hit 175 winners to 127 unforced errors. The basis of Świątek\\'s game was described by tennis journalist Christopher Clarey for The New York Times as: her sliding ability, allowing her to defend from the corners à la Kim Clijsters and Novak Djokovic, a \"sprinter\\'s speed\" when moving forward to the net, power and topspin akin to her idol Rafael Nadal, and mental strength forged through sports psychology.Her forehand and backhand are fast and powerful, with her forehand being hit with significant topspin due to her employing an extreme western grip; on her run to the title at the French Open in 2020, Świątek\\'s average forehand speed was 73 mph (117 km/h), only 4 km/h below that of the average male forehand speed. She even hit some forehands up to 79 mph (127 km/h), the fastest of any female player in the draw and exceeded only by Jannik Sinner on the men\\'s side. Her forehand topspin reached 3,453 rpm at the French Open, comparable with her idol Rafael Nadal. Świątek\\'s backhand speed peaked at 76 mph (122 km/h) at the French Open, the fastest of any female player in the draw, and equal to Dominic Thiem\\'s backhand speed, the fastest of any male player at the French Open.\\nŚwiątek aims to come to the net, and has good volleying skills due to her doubles experience. Świątek possesses an accurate first serve, peaking at 114 mph (183 km/h), and averaging at 103 mph (166 km/h), allowing her to serve aces, dictate play from the first stroke, and win a majority of first-serve points. She possesses an effective kick serve, and an effective slice serve, which are deployed as second serves, preventing opponents from scoring free points. She also regularly uses the drop shot, and won the 2019 WTA Shot of the Year with a cross-court drop shot from the baseline that landed on the sideline well inside the service box. Świątek aims to gain the advantage in a point by hitting the ball early on the rise. Further strengths include her exceptional speed, movement, and court coverage, detailed and intricate footwork, and intelligent point construction. Her favourite surface is clay, having grown up playing on that surface, although she has had success on all surfaces. Her clay court success is enhanced by her ability to slide on the surface; as her career has progressed, she has also developed the ability to slide on hard and grass courts, too.Świątek is a very popular player on the WTA Tour. She finished runner-up to Simona Halep in the voting for the WTA Fan Favorite Singles Player of the Year award in 2019. In 2020, she was voted the WTA Fan Favorite Singles Player of the Year.\\n\\n\\n== Coaching team ==\\nŚwiątek\\'s primary coach in her early junior years was Michał Kaznowski, who she worked with up to the 2016 French Open. Jolanta Rusin-Krzepota was her physical preparation trainer for almost four years through the end of the 2019 US Open.\\nŚwiątek was coached by Piotr Sierzputowski beginning in 2016. While Sierzputowski was her coach, British former professional tennis player and former Polish Davis Cup coach Nick Brown also served as a main consultant on occasion. Świątek also works with sports psychologist Daria Abramowicz and fitness trainer/physiologist Maciej Ryszczuk.In December 2021, Świątek announced that she was splitting from Sierzputowski after nearly six years working together. She wrote, \"This change is really challenging for me, and this decision wasn\\'t easy, either\". Świątek had hired Sierzputowski when she was 15 and still playing in junior tournaments. Her current coach is Tomasz Wiktorowski, who previously coached Agnieszka Radwańska.\\n\\n\\n== Endorsements ==\\nŚwiątek is now sponsored by the Roger Federer-backed Swiss company On for clothing and shoes, as of March 20, 2023, and became the first female tennis player to be sponsored by On. She had been sponsored by Asics for clothing and shoes since the start of 2020. She was previously sponsored by Nike. Świątek was also previously endorsed by the Red Bull energy drink company, the Chinese tech giant Xiaomi and the Lexus division of the Toyota automaker company, the latter of which have also sponsored fellow Polish tennis player Agnieszka Radwańska. In 2021, Świątek signed an endorsement deal with Tecnifibre for racquets; she previously used a Prince Textreme 100 Tour racquet, although she was not under contract with the company. To celebrate the victory at the 2022 French Open with a Tecnifibre racquet and to recognise the female athlete, the company changed its marketing name to Swiateknifibre and its trademark to the colours white and red for seven days. It was the first women\\'s Grand Slam title for this manufacturer.\\nŚwiątek\\'s father also confirmed that she had also signed a contract with Rolex in 2021. Since February 2021, her main partner is Poland\\'s biggest insurance company PZU. After winning her third Grand Slam title at the 2022 US Open, Świątek parted ways with her long-term manager, and began to be represented by IMG. In 2023, Świątek announced that she has become a global ambassador for the Polish sports drink Oshee. She will also release collaboration line with the brand, including her own drink flavour and bottle design.\\nOn 26 June 2023, Swiatek has announced her partnership with Porsche. In August, Swiatek  has been announced as a global ambassador of VISA. On 25 August, Infosys has announced Swiatek as their global brand ambassador alongside Rafael Nadal.\\n\\n\\n== Charity work and philanthropy ==\\nSince 2021 Świątek has been involved with The Great Orchestra of Christmas Charity. She has put up her winning racket from the final of her first French Open, the racket ended up getting sold with the price of 131,300 zł, which outpriced the signed Champions League winning kit of Robert Lewandowski, money helped to fund new equipment for pediatric ENT, otolaryngology and head diagnostics. In 2022, while playing at the Australian Open, she put up another racket, this time from final of Italian Open, but this time the offer also included training with the buyer.

The offer was yet again met with a lot of interest and in the end was sold for 189,100 zł, which was the second best seller. The money would help to fund equipment for pediatric ophthalmology. In 2023, Świątek put up her winning racket with which she won both US Open and French Open in 2022.

The pass would also allow the winners of the auction to watch all matches on the said day for free. All proceeds would go to funding medication for sepsis. Świątek\\'s offer was auctioned for 300,300 zł, making it the most expensive auction.\\nŚwiątek and her team have also been taking part in the Noble Gift project since 2020.

He is regarded as one of the best players of his generation and as one of the best strikers of all time, as well as one of the most successful players in Bundesliga and Bayern Munich history. He has scored over 600 senior career goals for club and country.\\nAfter being the top scorer in the third and second tiers of Polish football with Znicz Pruszków, Lewandowski moved to top-flight Lech Poznań, helping the team win the 2009–10 Ekstraklasa. In 2010, he transferred to Borussia Dortmund, where he won honors including two consecutive Bundesliga titles and the league\\'s top goalscorer award. In 2013, he also featured with Dortmund in the 2013 UEFA Champions League Final. Prior to the start of the 2014–15 season, Lewandowski agreed to join Dortmund\\'s domestic rivals, Bayern Munich, on a free transfer. In Munich, he won the Bundesliga title in every one of his eight seasons. Lewandowski was integral in Bayern\\'s UEFA Champions League win in 2019–20 as part of a treble. He is one of only two players, alongside Johan Cruyff, to achieve the European treble while being the highest goalscorer in all three competitions, and the first to do it as the sole top scorer. Lewandowski is also one of only two players to be top goalscorer for club and country in Europe for three consecutive years (2019–21), alongside Cristiano Ronaldo. He was widely considered the best player of 2020 and deserving of the Ballon d\\'Or, until it was canceled. In 2022, he was signed by Barcelona, where he won the Supercopa de España, the La Liga title and the Pichichi Trophy in his debut season. He holds the joint-record for most top scorer awards in Europe\\'s top five leagues with eight, alongside Lionel Messi, and the record for the most consecutive with six.A full international for Poland since 2008, Lewandowski has earned 146 caps and was a member of their team at the UEFA European Championship in 2012, 2016, and 2020, and the FIFA World Cup in 2018 and 2022.

Lewandowski has been named the VDV Bundesliga Player of the Season a record five times. He has scored over 300 goals in the Bundesliga (second-highest goalscorer of all time in Bundesliga, only behind Gerd Müller\\'s 365 Bundesliga goals), having reached the century mark quicker than any other foreign player, and is the league\\'s all-time leading foreign goalscorer.

In his very next fixture, he broke Pizarro\\'s record by scoring twice in a 6–0 win over Wolfsburg. On 6 April, in the 100th Bundesliga meeting between Bayern Munich and Dortmund, Lewandowski scored twice in a 5–0 win, with his first goal taking him to 200 goals in the league.Lewandowski ended the league campaign as the Bundesliga\\'s top goalscorer with 22 goals for the fourth time.

On 8 March, Lewandowski scored a hat-trick in a 7–1 win over Red Bull Salzburg in the second leg of Champions League round of 16. Coming inside the first 23 minutes of the match, Lewandowski\\'s hat-trick becomes the earliest ever scored by a player from the start of a Champions League match. Taking just 11 minutes from first goal to last, Lewandowski\\'s three-goal extravaganza against Salzburg also ranks as the quickest hat-trick ever scored in the knockout phases of the Champions League. With these goals he took himself beyond the 40-goal mark in all competitions for the seventh consecutive season. With the hat-trick, he also became the fastest player to 85 UCL goals, again edging past Lionel Messi\\'s previous record. He also joined Cristiano Ronaldo and Messi as the only three players to have ten or more goals in three or more UCL campaigns, and joined Messi as the only two players who have scored a first half hat trick in a UCL knockout game. However, Lewandowski finished the league with 35 goals as top scorer for the fifth consecutive season and seventh outright, equaling the record of Gerd Müller.

Three days later, Lewandowski signed a four-year contract for a fee of €45 million, potentially rising to €50 million with add-ons. The contract included a release clause set at €500 million.

On 8 November, Lewandowski was sent off for the second time in his club career for a foul on David García, later receiving a three-game ban, as Barcelona won 2–1 against Osasuna. However, Lewandowski participated in the 1–1 tie against rivals Espanyol on 31 December after his ban was suspended by a court in Madrid, but still ended up serving the disqualification, as Spain\\'s sports court upheld the punishment, missing the league matches against Atlético Madrid, Girona and Getafe.On 16 January 2023, he scored the second goal in the 2023 Supercopa de España final, as Barcelona defeated Real Madrid 3–1 in El Clásico, winning his first title with the club.

An accurate and efficient finisher with his head and both feet, Lewandowski is a prolific goalscorer, which has led him to be dubbed Lewangoalski. A well-rounded forward, he is said to possess almost all the necessary qualities of a traditional number nine: height, strength, balance, pace, intelligent movement and proficiency with both feet. Although he primarily operates as a goal-poacher in the penalty area, due to his positional sense, ability to shoot first time, strength in the air, and powerful shot with either foot, his excellent technical skills, quick feet, proficient dribbling, vision, and physique also enable him to hold up the ball with his back to goal and either bring his teammates into play, or win fouls for his team in useful positions; despite often functioning as a lone-centre forward or as an out-and-out striker.\\nHe has also stood out for his work-rate and defensive contribution off the ball, and is capable of dropping into deeper roles on the pitch, in order to create space for teammates with his movement, or surprise defenders by making late and sudden attacking runs into the area. Lewandowski is an accurate penalty taker and has repeatedly shown coolness and composure on the spot; he is also capable of scoring from long range, and has been known to take free kicks.

competition record (archived)', 'Cristiano Ronaldo dos Santos Aveiro  (Portuguese pronunciation: [kɾiʃˈtjɐnu ʁɔˈnaldu]; born 5 February 1985) is a Portuguese professional footballer who plays as a forward for and captains both Saudi Pro League club Al Nassr and the Portugal national team. Widely regarded as one of the greatest players of all time, Ronaldo has won five Ballon d\\'Or awards, a record three UEFA Men\\'s Player of the Year Awards, and four European Golden Shoes, the most by a European player. He has won 33 trophies in his career, including seven league titles, five UEFA Champions Leagues, the UEFA European Championship and the UEFA Nations League. Ronaldo holds the records for most appearances (183), goals (140) and assists (42) in the Champions League, goals in the European Championship (14), international goals (128) and international appearances (205). He is one of the few players to have made over 1,200 professional career appearances, the most by an outfield player, and has scored over 850 official senior career goals for club and country, making him the top goalscorer of all time.\\nRonaldo began his senior career with Sporting CP, before signing with Manchester United in 2003, winning the FA Cup in his first season. He would also go on to win three consecutive Premier League titles, the Champions League and the FIFA Club World Cup; at age 23, he won his first Ballon d\\'Or. Ronaldo was the subject of the then-most expensive association football transfer when he signed for Real Madrid in 2009 in a transfer worth €94 million (£80 million). He became a key contributor and formed an attacking trio with Karim Benzema and Gareth Bale which was integral to the team winning four Champions Leagues from 2014 to 2018, including La Décima. During this period, he won back-to-back Ballons d\\'Or in 2013 and 2014, and again in 2016 and 2017, and was runner-up three times behind Lionel Messi, his perceived career rival. He also became the club\\'s all-time top goalscorer and the all-time top scorer in the Champions League, and finished as the competition\\'s top scorer for six consecutive seasons between 2012 and 2018. With Real, Ronaldo won four Champions Leagues, two La Liga titles, two Copas del Rey, two UEFA Super Cups and three Club World Cups. In 2018, he signed for Juventus in a transfer worth an initial €100 million (£88 million), the most expensive transfer for an Italian club and for a player over 30 years old. He won two Serie A titles, two Supercoppa Italiana trophies and a Coppa Italia, became the inaugural Serie A Most Valuable Player and became the first footballer to finish as top scorer in the English, Spanish and Italian leagues. He returned to Manchester United in 2021, finishing his only full season as the club\\'s top scorer, before his contract was terminated in 2022. In 2023, he signed for Al Nassr.\\nRonaldo made his international debut for Portugal in 2003 at the age of 18 and has since earned more than 200 caps, making him both the country and history\\'s most-capped player of all time, recognised by the Guinness World Records. With more than 100 goals at international level, he is also the sports all-time top goalscorer. Ronaldo has played in and scored at eleven major tournaments; he scored his first international goal at Euro 2004, where he helped Portugal reach the final. He assumed captaincy of the national team in July 2008. In 2015, Ronaldo was named the best Portuguese player of all time by the Portuguese Football Federation. The following year, he led Portugal to their first major tournament title at Euro 2016, and received the Silver Boot as the second-highest goalscorer of the tournament. This achievement would see him receive his fourth Ballon d\\'Or. He also led them to victory in the inaugural UEFA Nations League in 2019, receiving the top scorer award in the finals, and later received the Golden Boot as top scorer of Euro 2020.\\nOne of the world\\'s most marketable and famous athletes, Ronaldo was ranked the world\\'s highest-paid athlete by Forbes in 2016, 2017, and 2023, and the world\\'s most famous athlete by ESPN from 2016 to 2019. Time included him on their list of the 100 most influential people in the world in 2014. He is the first footballer and the third sportsman to earn US$1 billion in his career.\\n\\n\\n== Early life ==\\nCristiano Ronaldo dos Santos Aveiro was born on 5 February 1985 in the São Pedro parish of Funchal, the capital of the Portuguese island of Madeira, and grew up in the nearby parish of Santo António. He is the fourth and youngest child of Maria Dolores dos Santos Viveiros da Aveiro, who worked as a cook in the hospitality industry and a cleaning woman, and José Dinis Aveiro, a municipal gardener at the Junta de Freguesia of Santo António and part-time kit man for football club Andorinha. His great-grandmother on his father\\'s side, Isabel da Piedade, an African woman, was born in the island of São Vicente, in what was then Portuguese Cape Verde, and moved to Madeira Island at 16. He has one older brother, Hugo, and two older sisters, Elma and Liliana Cátia \"Katia\". He was named after actor and U.S. President Ronald Reagan, whom his father was a fan of. His mother revealed that she wanted to abort him due to poverty, his father\\'s alcoholism, and having too many children already, but her doctor refused to perform the procedure, as abortions were illegal in Portugal at that time. Ronaldo grew up in an impoverished Roman Catholic home, sharing a room with all his siblings.As a child, Ronaldo played for Andorinha from 1992 to 1995, where his father was the kit man, and later spent two years with Nacional. In 1997, aged 12, he went on a three-day trial with Sporting CP, who signed him for a fee of £1,500. He subsequently moved from Madeira to Lisbon to join Sporting CP\\'s youth system. By age 14, while struggling with his school duties and responsibilities in Escola EB2 de Telheiras, his school in the Telheiras area of Lisbon, Ronaldo believed he had the ability to play semi-professionally and agreed with his mother and his tutor at Sporting CP, Leonel Pontes, to cease his education to focus entirely on football. With a troubled life as a student and living in Lisbon area away from his Madeiran family, he did not complete schooling beyond the 6th grade. While popular with other students at school, he had been expelled after throwing a chair at his teacher, who he said had \"disrespected\" him. One year later, he was diagnosed with tachycardia, a condition that could have forced him to give up playing football. Ronaldo underwent heart surgery where a laser was used to cauterise multiple cardiac pathways into one, altering his resting heart rate. He was discharged from the hospital hours after the procedure and resumed training a few days later. In 2021, Cristiano Ronaldo\\'s mother, Dolores Aveiro, stated in an interview for Sporting CP\\'s official television channel (Sporting TV) that her son would be a bricklayer if he hadn\\'t become a professional football player.\\n\\n\\n== Club career ==\\n\\n\\n=== Sporting CP ===\\nAt age 16, Ronaldo was promoted from Sporting\\'s youth team by first-team manager László Bölöni, who was impressed with his dribbling. He subsequently became the first player to play for the club\\'s under-16, under-17 and under-18 teams, the B team and the first team, all within a single season.On 14 August 2002, Cristiano Ronaldo, then 17, played his first official match for a Sporting CP\\'s senior team, in a UEFA Champions League qualifying round at José Alvalade Stadium against Inter Milan. He came on in the 58th minute in place of Toñito.As far as the Portuguese football league system\\'s competitions is concerned, Sporting CP B was the 1st team in his senior career playing domestically, where he debuted in a 2–1 away loss against Sport Clube Lusitânia on 1 September 2002, in a game for the Segunda Divisão B championship played in the Azores. On 29 September 2002, Ronaldo made his debut in the Primeira Liga, playing for Sporting CP\\'s main team against Braga, and on 7 October, he scored two goals against Moreirense in their 3–0 win. Over the course of the 2002–03 season, his representatives suggested the player to Liverpool manager Gérard Houllier and Barcelona president Joan Laporta. Manager Arsène Wenger, who was interested in signing Ronaldo, met with him at Arsenal\\'s stadium in November to discuss a possible transfer.Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson was determined to acquire Ronaldo on a permanent move urgently, after Sporting defeated United 3–1 at the inauguration of the Estádio José Alvalade on 6 August 2003. Initially, United had planned to sign Ronaldo and loan him back to Sporting for a year. Having been impressed by him, the United players urged Ferguson to sign him. After the game, Ferguson agreed to pay Sporting £12.24 million for what he considered to be \"one of the most exciting young players\" he had ever seen. A decade after his departure from the club, in 2013, Sporting honoured Ronaldo by selecting him to become their 100,000th member.\\n\\n\\n=== Manchester United ===\\n\\n\\n==== 2003–2007: Development and breakthrough ====\\n\\nRonaldo\\'s move to Manchester United was completed on 12 August 2003, too late for the 2003 FA Community Shield but in time for their game against Bolton Wanderers on the opening day of the 2003–04 season, and made him the first Portuguese player to sign for the club. His transfer fee made him, at the time, the most expensive teenager in English football history. Although he requested the number 28, his number at Sporting, he received the squad number 7 shirt, which had previously been worn by such United players as George Best, Eric Cantona and David Beckham. Wearing the number 7 became an extra source of motivation for Ronaldo. A key element in his development during his time in England proved to be Ferguson, of whom he later said: \"He\\'s been my father in sport, one of the most important and influential factors in my career.\"\\nRonaldo made his debut as a substitute in a 4–0 home win over Bolton Wanderers in the Premier League on 16 August 2003, and received a standing ovation when he came on for Nicky Butt. His performance earned praise from Best, who hailed it as \"undoubtedly the most exciting debut\" he had ever seen. Ronaldo scored his first goal for Manchester United with a free-kick in a 3–0 win over Portsmouth on 1 November. Three more league goals followed in the second half of the campaign, the last of which came against Aston Villa on the final day of the season, a match in which he also received the first red card of his career. Ronaldo ended his first season in English football by scoring the opening goal in United\\'s 3–0 win over Millwall in the 2004 FA Cup Final, earning his first trophy. BBC pundit Alan Hansen described him as the star of the final. The British press had been critical of Ronaldo during the season for his \"elaborate\" step-overs in trying to beat opponents, but teammate Gary Neville said he was \"not a show pony, but the real thing\", and predicted he would become a world-class player.\\n\\nRonaldo scored United\\'s 1,000th Premier League goal on 29 October 2004, their only goal in a 4–1 loss to Middlesbrough. A few weeks later, he signed a new contract with the club that extended his previous deal by two years to 2010. At the start of 2005, Ronaldo played two of his best matches of the 2004–05 season, producing a goal and an assist against Aston Villa and scoring twice against rivals Arsenal. He played the full 120 minutes of the 2005 FA Cup Final against Arsenal, which ended in a goalless draw; although Ronaldo scored his attempt in the penalty shoot-out, United lost 5–4. Ronaldo won his second trophy in English football, the Football League Cup, after scoring the third goal in United\\'s 4–0 final win over Wigan Athletic.During his third season in England, Ronaldo was involved in several incidents. He had a one-match ban imposed on him by UEFA for a \"one-fingered gesture\" towards Benfica fans, and was sent off in the Manchester derby (a 3–1 defeat) for kicking Manchester City\\'s former United player Andy Cole. Ronaldo clashed with a teammate, striker Ruud van Nistelrooy, who took offence at the winger\\'s showboating style of play. Following the 2006 FIFA World Cup, in which he was involved in an incident where club teammate Wayne Rooney was sent off, Ronaldo publicly asked for a transfer, lamenting the lack of support he felt he had received from the club over the incident. United denied the possibility of him leaving the club.Although his World Cup altercation with Rooney resulted in Ronaldo being booed throughout the 2006–07 season, it proved to be his break-out year, as he broke the 20-goal barrier for the first time and won his first Premier League title. An important factor in this success was his one-to-one training by first-team coach René Meulensteen, who taught him to make himself more unpredictable, improve his teamwork, call for the ball and capitalise on goalscoring opportunities rather than waiting for the chance to score the aesthetically pleasing goals for which he was already known. He scored three consecutive braces at the end of December, against Aston Villa (a win that put United on top of the league), Wigan and Reading. Ronaldo was named the Premier League Player of the Month in November and December, becoming only the third player to receive consecutive honours.\\n\\n\\n==== 2007–2008: Collective and individual success ====\\nAt the quarter-final stage of the 2006–07 UEFA Champions League, Ronaldo scored his first goals in his 30th match in the competition, scoring twice in a 7–1 win over Roma. He subsequently scored four minutes into the first semi-final leg against Milan, which ended in a 3–2 win, but was marked out of the second leg as United lost 3–0 at the San Siro. He also helped United reach the 2007 FA Cup Final, but the final against Chelsea ended in a 1–0 defeat. Ronaldo scored the only goal in the Manchester derby on 5 May (his 50th goal for the club), as United won their first league title in four years. As a result of his performances, he amassed a host of personal awards for the season. He won the Professional Footballers\\' Association\\'s Player\\'s Player, Fans\\' Player and Young Player of the Year awards, as well as the Football Writers\\' Association\\'s Footballer of the Year award, becoming the first player to win all four main PFA and FWA honours. His wages were raised to £120,000 a week as part of a five-year contract extension. Ronaldo was named runner-up to Kaká for the 2007 Ballon d\\'Or, and came third, behind Kaká and Lionel Messi, in the running for the 2007 FIFA World Player of the Year award.Ronaldo scored his first hat-trick for United in a 6–0 win against Newcastle United on 12 January 2008, which put United top of the league table. On 19 March, he captained United for the first time in a home win over Bolton and scored both goals in a 2–0 win. His second goal was his 33rd of the campaign, surpassing George Best\\'s total of 32 goals in the 1967–68 season, setting the club\\'s new single-season record by a midfielder. His 31 league goals earned him the Premier League Golden Boot, as well as the European Golden Shoe, which made him the first winger to win the latter award. He additionally received the PFA Players\\' Player of the Year and FWA Footballer of the Year awards for the second consecutive season. In the knockout stage of the Champions League, Ronaldo scored the decisive goal against Lyon to help United advance to the quarter-finals 2–1 on aggregate; while playing as a striker, he scored with a header in the 3–0 aggregate win over Roma. United reached the final against Chelsea in Moscow on 21 May, where, despite his opening goal being negated by an equaliser and his penalty kick being saved in the shoot-out, United emerged victorious 1–1, winning the penalties 6–5. As the Champions League top scorer, Ronaldo was named the UEFA Club Footballer of the Year.Ronaldo scored a total of 42 goals in all competitions during the 2007–08 season, his most prolific campaign during his time in England. He missed three matches after headbutting a Portsmouth player at the start of the season, an experience he said taught him not to let opponents provoke him. As rumours circulated of Ronaldo\\'s interest in moving to Real Madrid, United filed a tampering complaint with governing body FIFA over Madrid\\'s alleged pursuit of their player, but they declined to take action. FIFA president Sepp Blatter asserted that the player should be allowed to leave his club, describing the situation as \"modern slavery\". Despite Ronaldo publicly agreeing with Blatter, he remained at United for another year.\\n\\n\\n==== 2008–2009: Ballon d\\'Or and continued success ====\\nAhead of the 2008–09 season, on 7 July, Ronaldo underwent ankle surgery, which kept him out of action for 10 weeks. Following his return, he scored his 100th goal in all competitions for United with the first of two free kicks in a 5–0 win against Stoke City on 15 November, which meant he had now scored against all 19 opposition teams in the Premier League at the time. At the close of 2008, Ronaldo helped United win the 2008 FIFA Club World Cup in Japan, assisting the final-winning goal against Liga de Quito and winning the Silver Ball in the process. With his 2008 Ballon d\\'Or and 2008 FIFA World Player of the Year, Ronaldo became United\\'s first Ballon d\\'Or winner since Best in 1968, and the first Premier League player to be named the FIFA World Player of the Year.His match-winning goal in the second leg against Porto, a 40-yard strike, earned him the inaugural FIFA Puskás Award, presented by FIFA in recognition of the best goal of the year; he later called it the best goal he had ever scored. United advanced to the final in Rome, where he made little impact in United\\'s 2–0 defeat to Barcelona. Ronaldo ended his time in England with nine trophies, as United claimed their third successive league title and a Football League Cup. He finished the campaign with 26 goals in all competitions, 16 goals fewer than the previous season, in four more appearances. His final goal for United came on 10 May 2009 with a free kick in the Manchester derby at Old Trafford.\\n\\n\\n=== Real Madrid ===\\nAhead of the 2009–10 season, Ronaldo joined Real Madrid for a world record transfer fee at the time of £80 million (€94 million). His contract, which ran until 2015, was worth €11 million per year and contained a €1 billion buy-out clause. At least 80,000 fans attended his presentation at the Santiago Bernabéu, surpassing the 25-year record of 75,000 fans who had welcomed Diego Maradona at Napoli. Since club captain Raúl already wore the number 7 (the number Ronaldo wore at United), Ronaldo received the number 9 shirt, which was presented to him by former Madrid player Alfredo Di Stéfano.\\n\\n\\n==== 2009–2013: World record transfer and La Liga title ====\\nRonaldo made his La Liga debut against Deportivo La Coruña on 29 August, scoring a penalty in a 3–2 home win. He scored in each of his first four league games, the first Madrid player to do so. His first Champions League goals for the club followed with two free kicks in the first group match against Zürich. His strong start to the season was interrupted when he suffered an ankle injury in October while on international duty, which kept him sidelined for seven weeks. A week after his return, he received his first red card in Spain in a match against Almería. Midway through the season, Ronaldo finished second in the 2009 Ballon d\\'Or and the 2009 FIFA World Player of the Year awards, behind Messi. He finished the season with 33 goals in all competitions, including a hat-trick in a 4–1 win against Mallorca on 5 May 2010, his first in La Liga, and became Real Madrid\\'s highest goalscorer that season. Although Ronaldo helped amass a club record 96 points in the league, he did not win a trophy in his first season.Following Raúl\\'s departure, Ronaldo was given the number 7 shirt for Madrid before the 2010–11 season. His subsequent return to his Ballon d\\'Or-winning form was epitomised when, for the first time in his career, he scored four goals in a single match during a 6–1 rout against Racing Santander on 23 October. Ronaldo subsequently scored further hat-tricks against Athletic Bilbao, Levante, Villarreal and Málaga. Despite his performances, he did not make the top three in the inaugural 2010 FIFA Ballon d\\'Or. During a historic series of four Clásicos against rivals Barcelona in April 2011, Ronaldo scored twice to equal his personal record of 42 goals in all competitions. Though he failed to score in either leg of the Champions League semi-finals as Madrid were eliminated, he equalised from the penalty spot in the return league game and scored the match-winning goal in the 103rd minute of the 2011 Copa del Rey Final, winning his first trophy in Spain. His two goals in the last match of the season against Almería made him the first player in La Liga to score 40 goals. In addition to the Pichichi Trophy, Ronaldo won the European Golden Shoe for a second time, becoming the first player to win the award in different leagues.\\nDuring the following season, Ronaldo achieved a new personal best of 60 goals in all competitions. He finished as runner-up to Messi for the 2011 FIFA Ballon d\\'Or, after scoring hat-tricks against Real Zaragoza, Rayo Vallecano, Málaga, Osasuna and Sevilla, the last of which put Madrid on top of the league by the season\\'s midway point. Ronaldo found greater team success in the league, helping Madrid win their first league title in four years with a record 100 points. Following a hat-trick against Levante as Madrid further increased their lead over Barcelona, he scored his 100th league goal for Madrid in a 5–1 win over Real Sociedad on 24 March 2012, a milestone he reached in just 92 matches across three seasons, breaking the previous club record held by Ferenc Puskás. Another hat-trick in the Madrid derby against Atlético Madrid brought his total to 40 league goals, equalling his record of the previous season. His final league goal of the season, against Mallorca, took his total to 46 goals, four short of the new record set by Messi, though he became the first player to score against all 19 opposition teams in a single La Liga season.Ronaldo began the 2012–13 season by lifting the 2012 Supercopa de España, his third trophy in Spain. With a goal in each leg, he helped Madrid win the Spanish Super Cup on away goals following a 4–4 aggregate draw against Barcelona. Although Ronaldo publicly commented that he was unhappy with a \"professional issue\" within the club, prompted by his refusal to celebrate his 150th goal for Madrid, his goalscoring rate did not suffer. After netting a hat-trick, including two penalties, against Deportivo, he scored his first hat-trick in the Champions League in a 4–1 win over Ajax. Four days later, he became the first player to score in six successive Clásicos when he hit a brace in a 2–2 draw at Camp Nou. His performances again saw Ronaldo voted second in the running for the 2012 FIFA Ballon d\\'Or, behind four-time winner Messi.\\n\\n\\n==== 2013–2015: Consecutive Ballon d\\'Or wins and La Décima ====\\nFollowing the 2012–13 winter break, Ronaldo captained Madrid for the first time in an official match, scoring twice to lift 10-man Madrid to a 4–3 win over Sociedad on 6 January. He subsequently became the first non-Spanish player in 60 years to captain Madrid in El Clasico on 30 January, a match which also marked his 500th club appearance. Three days prior, he had scored his 300th club goal as part of a perfect hat-trick against Getafe. He scored his 200th goal for Madrid on 8 May in a 6–2 win against Málaga, reaching the landmark in 197 games. He helped Madrid reach the 2013 Copa del Rey Final by scoring twice in El Clásico, which marked the sixth successive match at Camp Nou in which he had scored, a club record. In the final, he headed the opening goal of an eventual 2–1 extra time defeat to Atlético, but was shown a red card for violent conduct. In the first knockout round of the Champions League, Ronaldo faced his former club Manchester United for the first time. After scoring the equaliser in a 1–1 draw at home, he scored the winning goal in a 2–1 win on his first return to Old Trafford. He did not celebrate scoring against his former club as a mark of respect. After scoring three goals against Galatasaray in the quarters, he scored Madrid\\'s only goal in the 4–1 away defeat to Borussia Dortmund in the semi-finals and Real were eliminated at the semi-final stage for the third consecutive year despite a 2–0 win in the second leg.\\nAt the start of the 2013–14 season, Ronaldo signed a new contract that extended his stay by three years to 2018, with a salary of €17 million net, making him briefly the highest-paid player in football. He was joined at the club by winger Gareth Bale, whose world record transfer fee of €100 million surpassed the fee Madrid had paid for Ronaldo four years prior. Together with striker Karim Benzema, they formed an attacking trio popularly dubbed \"BBC\", an acronym of Bale, Benzema and Cristiano, and a play on the name of the British public service broadcaster, the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC). By late November, Ronaldo had scored 32 goals from 22 matches for both club and country, including hat-tricks against Galatasaray, Sevilla, Real Sociedad, Northern Ireland, and Sweden. He ended 2013 with 69 goals in 59 appearances, his highest year-end goal tally. He received the 2013 FIFA Ballon d\\'Or, an amalgamation of the Ballon d\\'Or and the FIFA World Player of the Year award, for the first time in his career.Concurrently with his individual achievements, Ronaldo enjoyed his greatest team success in Spain to date, as he helped Madrid win La Décima, their tenth European Cup. His goal in a 3–0 home win over Dortmund (his 100th Champions League match) took his total for the season to 14 goals, equalling the record Messi had set two years before. After hitting a brace in a 4–0 defeat of Bayern Munich at the Allianz Arena, he scored from the penalty spot in the 120th minute of the 4–1 final win over Atlético, becoming the first player to score in two European Cup finals for two different winning teams. His overall performance in the final was subdued as a result of patellar tendinitis and related hamstring problems, which had plagued him in the last months of the campaign. Ronaldo played the final against medical advice, later commenting: \"In your life you do not win without sacrifices and you must take risks\". As the competition\\'s top goalscorer for the third time, with a record 17 goals, he was named the UEFA Best Player in Europe.In the Copa del Rey, Ronaldo helped Madrid reach the final by scoring two penalties against Atlético at the Vicente Calderón, the first of which meant he had now scored in every single minute of a 90-minute football match. His continued issues with his knee and thigh caused him to miss the final, where Madrid defeated Barcelona 2–1 to claim the trophy. Ronaldo scored 31 goals in 30 league games, which earned him the Pichichi and the European Golden Shoe, receiving the latter award jointly with Liverpool striker Luis Suárez. Among his haul was his 400th career goal, in 653 appearances for club and country, which came with a brace against Celta Vigo on 6 January; he dedicated his goals to compatriot Eusébio, who had died two days before. A last-minute, back-heeled volley scored against Valencia on 4 May (his 50th goal in all competitions) was recognised as the best goal of the season by the Liga Nacional de Fútbol Profesional, which additionally named Ronaldo the Best Player in La Liga.\\nDuring the 2014–15 season, Ronaldo set a new personal best of 61 goals, starting with both goals in Madrid\\'s 2–0 win over Sevilla in the UEFA Super Cup. He subsequently achieved his best-ever goalscoring start to a league campaign, with 15 goals in the first eight rounds. His record 23rd La Liga hat-trick, scored against Celta Vigo on 6 December, made him the fastest player to reach 200 goals in La Liga, reaching the milestone in 178th matches. After winning the 2014 FIFA Club World Cup, Ronaldo received the 2014 Ballon d\\'Or, joining Johan Cruyff, Michel Platini and Marco van Basten as a three-time recipient. Madrid finished in second place in La Liga and exited at the semi-final stage in the Champions League. In the latter competition, Ronaldo extended his run of scoring away to a record 12 matches with his strike in a 2–0 win against Schalke 04. He scored both of his side\\'s goals in the semi-finals against Juventus, where Madrid were eliminated 3–2 on aggregate. With 10 goals, he finished as top scorer for a third consecutive season, alongside Messi and Neymar. On 5 April, he scored five goals in a game for the first time in his career, including an eight-minute hat-trick, in a 9–1 rout of Granada. His 300th goal for his club followed three days later in a 2–0 win against Rayo Vallecano. Subsequent hat-tricks against Sevilla, Espanyol and Getafe took his number of hat-tricks for Madrid to 31, surpassing Di Stéfano\\'s club record of 28. He finished the season with 48 goals, winning a second consecutive Pichichi and the European Golden Shoe for a record fourth time.\\n\\n\\n==== 2015–2017: All-time Madrid top scorer ====\\nAt the start of his seventh season at Madrid, the 2015–16 campaign, Ronaldo became the club\\'s all-time top scorer, first in the league and then in all competitions. His five-goal haul in a 6–0 away win over Espanyol on 12 September took his tally in La Liga to 230 goals in 203 games, surpassing the club\\'s previous record holder, Raúl. A month later, on 17 October, he again surpassed Raúl when he scored the second goal in a 3–0 defeat of Levante at the Bernabéu to take his overall total for the club to 324 goals. Ronaldo also became the all-time top scorer in the Champions League with a hat-trick in the first group match against Shakhtar Donetsk, having finished the previous season level with Messi on 77 goals.

The treble took his tally in the competition to 16 goals, making him the top scorer for the fourth consecutive season and the fifth overall.

For his efforts during the season, he received the UEFA Best Player in Europe Award for a second time.Ronaldo missed Madrid\\'s first three matches of the 2016–17 season, including the 2016 UEFA Super Cup against Sevilla, as he continued to rehabilitate the knee injury he suffered against France in the Euro 2016 final.

He won the 2016 Ballon d\\'Or, his fourth, and the inaugural 2016 The Best FIFA Men\\'s Player, a revival of the former FIFA World Player of the Year, largely owing to his success with Portugal in winning Euro 2016.\\nIn the 2016–17 UEFA Champions League quarter-finals against Bayern in April, Ronaldo scored both goals in a 2–1 away win which saw him make history by becoming the first player to reach 100 goals in UEFA club competition. In the second leg of the quarter-finals, Ronaldo scored a \\'perfect\\' hat-trick and reached his 100th Champions League goal, becoming the first player to do so as Madrid again defeated Bayern 4–2 after extra-time.

Madrid also became the first team to win back-to-back finals in the Champions League era.\\n\\n\\n==== 2017–2018: Fifth Ballon d\\'Or and fifth Champions League win ====\\nAt the start of the 2017–18 season, Ronaldo scored Madrid\\'s second goal in the 80th minute of a 3–1 win over Barcelona in the first leg of the 2017 Supercopa de España at Camp Nou; however, he was sent off two minutes later and missed the second leg.

A day later, Ronaldo won the 2017 Ballon d\\'Or, receiving his fifth-time award on the Eiffel Tower in Paris. On 16 December, he scored a free kick winner, as Madrid won their second Club World Cup in a row by beating Grêmio in the final. On 3 March 2018, he scored two goals in a 3–1 home win over Getafe, his first being his 300th La Liga goal in his 286th appearance, making him the fastest player to reach this landmark and only the second player to do so after Messi.

Described as a \"PlayStation goal\" by Juventus defender Andrea Barzagli, with Ronaldo\\'s foot approximately 7 ft 7 in (2.31 m) off the ground, it garnered him a standing ovation from the opposing fans in the stadium as well as a plethora of plaudits from peers, pundits and coaches. On 11 April, he scored in the second leg at home to Juventus, a 98th-minute injury time penalty in a 3–1 defeat, meaning Madrid advanced 4–3 on aggregate.

The transfer was the highest ever for a player over 30 years old, and the highest paid by an Italian club. Upon signing, Ronaldo cited his need for a new challenge as his rationale for departing Madrid, but later attributed the transfer to the lack of support he felt was shown by club president Florentino Pérez.\\n\\n\\n==== 2018–2020: Consecutive Serie A titles ====\\nOn 18 August, Ronaldo made his debut in a 3–2 away win against Chievo Verona. On 16 September, Ronaldo scored his first two goals for Juventus in his fourth appearance in a 2–1 home win over Sassuolo in Serie A; his second was the 400th league goal of his career.

In December, he scored his tenth league goal of the season, from the penalty spot, the third in a 3–0 away win over Fiorentina. After placing second in both the UEFA Men\\'s Player of the Year and The Best FIFA Men\\'s Player for the first time in three years, behind Luka Modrić, Ronaldo performances in 2018 also saw him voted runner-up for the 2018 Ballon d\\'Or, finishing once again behind his former teammate.

On 26 August, Ronaldo and his agent Jorge Mendes reached a verbal agreement with Manchester City over personal terms, but the club pulled out of the deal the following day due to the overall cost of the transfer. On the same day, it was confirmed that City\\'s rivals Manchester United, Ronaldo\\'s former club, were in advanced talks to sign him, while former manager Alex Ferguson and several ex-teammates had been in contact to persuade him to re-sign for United.\\n\\n\\n=== Return to Manchester United ===\\n\\n\\n==== 2021–2022: 100 Premier League goals and team struggles ====\\nOn 27 August 2021, Manchester United announced they had reached an agreement with Juventus to re-sign Ronaldo, subject to agreement of personal terms, visa and medical. The transfer was for an initial £12.85 million, with a two-year contract plus an optional year, and was confirmed on 31 August.

On 2 December, Ronaldo netted two goals in a 3–2 home league win against Arsenal, which saw him surpass 800 career goals.The following month, after enduring a fractured relationship with his teammates and interim manager Ralf Rangnick, his performances and his team\\'s declined during the season, with Ronaldo equalling his worst goalscoring run since 2010 during his time with Real Madrid, being two months without scoring a goal, before scoring his first goal in the new year, opening United\\'s 2–0 win home against Brighton & Hove Albion on 15 February 2022. Following a hamstring injury, which saw him miss the Manchester derby against Manchester City, Ronaldo made his return from injury on 12 March, scoring a hat-trick in a 3–2 victory against Tottenham Hotspur, which saw him pass Josef Bican\\'s record for goals scored in professional football with 807 career goals, although the Football Association of the Czech Republic claimed that Bican had scored 821 career goals.

His agent Jorge Mendes began negotiating with various clubs for a transfer on loan or on a free transfer, including Bayern Munich, Paris Saint-Germain and Chelsea, with the latter club\\'s new owner Todd Boehly being keen on a possible transfer. However, due to his age, overall cost of a transfer and high wages demands, multiple European clubs rejected the opportunity to sign him, including Chelsea after their manager Thomas Tuchel did not approve his signing.\\nHaving failed to secure a transfer, Ronaldo lost his place in the starting line-up to Marcus Rashford and Anthony Martial, mostly featuring in Europa League matches. He scored his first goal in the competition aged 37, converting a penalty to make it 2–0 against Sheriff Tiraspol on 15 September. On 2 October, Ronaldo was an unused substitute in United\\'s 6–3 loss to Manchester City, with ten Hag saying that he refused to bring him on out of \"respect for his big career\". On 9 October, Ronaldo came on as a substitute and scored his 700th career club goal in a 2–1 win against Everton. Ten days later, Ronaldo refused to be brought on as a substitute during a home game against Tottenham and left the ground before the full-time whistle; Ten Hag punished him by dropping him from the squad for an upcoming fixture with Chelsea, and made him train separately from the first team. Following discussions with the manager, Ronaldo returned to training and started in United\\'s home win over Sheriff on 27 October, scoring the third goal and ensuring United\\'s qualification to the Europa League knockout stage. Ten Hag named Ronaldo as captain for a 3–1 defeat to Aston Villa on 6 November, saying that Ronaldo was \"an important part of the squad, we are happy with him and now he has to take even more of the leader role\". Ronaldo then missed United\\'s following matches before the World Cup break, with Ten Hag saying that Ronaldo was ill.On 14 November, an interview with Piers Morgan was published, where Ronaldo said that he felt \"betrayed\" by Ten Hag and senior executives who wanted Ronaldo to leave the club, and accused the club of doubting him regarding the illness of his daughter that led him to miss pre-season, adding that he did not respect ten Hag \"because he doesn\\'t show respect for me\", leading him to be disappointed with the communication of the club. Ronaldo claimed that ten Hag deliberately provoked him by first leaving him on the bench against City, and then wanting to bring him on in the final moments against Tottenham, but added that he regretted his decision to leave early. He also questioned the appointment of Rangnick the previous season as he was a \"sporting director and not even a coach\". On the club itself, Ronaldo stated there was \"no evolution\" since the departure of former manager Alex Ferguson in 2013, despite expecting changes in \"technology, infrastructure\". Ronaldo claimed that the Glazer family \"did not care about the club\" as he never spoke with them, and described United as a \"marketing club\". Following the interview, which aired in two-parts on 16 and 17 November, United began seeking legal action over whether Ronaldo had breached his contract, and were looking to terminate his contract. On 22 November, Ronaldo\\'s contract was terminated by mutual agreement with immediate effect.\\n\\n\\n=== Al Nassr ===\\nOn 30 December 2022, Saudi club Al Nassr reached an agreement for Ronaldo to join the club effective 1 January 2023, signing a contract until 2025.

After scoring the winner in a 1–0 win away in his 1000th club appearance, he scored the winning goal in a 2–0 win at home, helping Al-Nassr reach the quarter-finals of the competition. On 25 February 2024, Ronaldo was filmed making an alleged obscene gesture towards rival fans who were jeering him after a 3–2 victory over Al-Shabab. This act resulted in Ronaldo being suspended four days later for one match by the Disciplinary and Ethics Committee of the Saudi Arabia Football Federation. On 11 March, Ronaldo became the first football player to achieve 800 career wins following a match against Al Ain in the second leg of the AFC Champions League quarter-finals. Four days later, Ronaldo scored his 50th goal for Al-Nassr, netting a penalty in a narrow 1–0 win over rivals Al-Ahli.\\n\\n\\n== International career ==\\n\\n\\n=== 2001–2007: Youth level and senior debut ===\\nRonaldo began his international career with Portugal under-15 in 2001. During his international youth career, Ronaldo would represent the under-15, under-17, under-20, under-21 and under-23 national sides, amassing 34 youth caps and scoring 18 goals overall.Aged 18, Ronaldo made his first senior appearance for Portugal in a 1–0 win over Kazakhstan on 20 August 2003, coming on as a half-time substitute for Luís Figo. He was subsequently called up for UEFA Euro 2004, held in his home country, and scored his first international goal in a 2–1 group stage loss to eventual champions Greece, his eighth appearance for Portugal. After converting his penalty in a shoot-out against England in the quarter-finals, he helped Portugal reach the final by scoring the opening goal in a 2–1 win over the Netherlands. He was featured in the team of the tournament, having provided two assists in addition to his two goals.Ronaldo was Portugal\\'s second-highest scorer in their qualification group for the 2006 FIFA World Cup with seven goals. During the tournament, he scored his first World Cup goal against Iran with a penalty kick in Portugal\\'s second match of the group stage. At the age of 21 years and 132 days, Ronaldo became the youngest ever goalscorer for Portugal at a World Cup finals. In Portugal\\'s infamously dirty round of 16 match against the Netherlands, Ronaldo was forced off injured in the first half after a tackle from Dutch defender Khalid Boulahrouz. Following Portugal\\'s 1–0 win, Ronaldo accused Boulahrouz of intentionally trying to injure him, although he recovered in time to play in the next game. In Portugal\\'s quarter-final against England, Ronaldo\\'s Manchester United teammate Wayne Rooney was sent off for stamping on Portugal defender Ricardo Carvalho. Although the referee later clarified that the red card was only due to Rooney\\'s infraction, the English media speculated that Ronaldo had influenced his decision by aggressively complaining, after which he was seen in replays winking at Portugal\\'s bench following Rooney\\'s dismissal. Ronaldo went on to score the vital winning penalty during the shoot-out which sent Portugal into the semi-finals. Ronaldo was subsequently booed during their 1–0 semi-final defeat to France. FIFA\\'s Technical Study Group overlooked him for the tournament\\'s Best Young Player award and handed it to Germany\\'s Lukas Podolski, citing his behaviour as a factor in the decision. Following the 2006 World Cup, Ronaldo would go on to represent Portugal in four qualifying games for Euro 2008, scoring two goals in the process.\\n\\n\\n=== 2007–2012: Assuming captaincy ===\\nOne day after turning 22, Ronaldo captained Portugal for the first time in a friendly game against Brazil on 6 February 2007, as requested by Portuguese Football Federation (FPF) president Carlos Silva, who had died two days earlier. Ahead of Euro 2008, he was given the number 7 shirt for the first time. While he scored eight goals in qualifications, the second-highest tally, he scored just one goal in the tournament, netting the second goal of their 3–1 win in the group stage match against the Czech Republic. In the same game, he also set-up Portugal\\'s third goal in injury time, which was scored by Quaresma, and was named man of the match for his performance. Portugal were eliminated in the quarter-finals with a 3–2 loss against eventual finalists Germany.After Portugal\\'s unsuccessful performance at Euro 2008, Luiz Felipe Scolari was replaced as coach by Carlos Queiroz, formerly the assistant manager at United. Queiroz made Ronaldo the squad\\'s permanent captain in July 2008. Ronaldo failed to score a single goal in the qualification for the 2010 World Cup, as Portugal narrowly avoided a premature elimination from the tournament with a play-off victory over Bosnia and Herzegovina. In the group stage of the World Cup, he was named man of the match in all three matches, against Ivory Coast, North Korea and Brazil. His only goal of the tournament came in their 7–0 rout of North Korea, which marked his first international goal in 16 months. Portugal\\'s World Cup ended with a 1–0 loss against eventual champions Spain in the round of 16.Ronaldo scored seven goals in qualifications for Euro 2012, including two strikes against Bosnia and Herzegovina in the play-offs, to send Portugal into the tournament, where they were drawn in a \"group of death\". In the last group stage game against the Netherlands, Ronaldo scored twice to secure a 2–1 win. He scored a header in the quarter-final against the Czech Republic to give his team a 1–0 win. In both games against the Netherlands and the Czech Republic he was named man of the match. After the semi-finals against Spain ended scoreless, Portugal were eliminated in the penalty shoot-out. Ronaldo did not take a penalty as he had been slated to take the unused fifth slot. Ronaldo\\'s own teammate, Nani, said that Ronaldo \"demanded\" to take the last penalty. As the joint top scorer with three goals, alongside five other players, he was again included in the team of the tournament.\\n\\n\\n=== 2012–2016: All-time Portugal top scorer and European champion ===\\nDuring the qualification for the 2014 World Cup, Ronaldo scored a total of eight goals. A qualifying match on 17 October 2012, a 1–1 draw against Northern Ireland, earned him his 100th cap. His first international hat-trick also came against Northern Ireland, when he scored three times in a 15-minute spell of a 4–2 qualifying win on 6 September 2013. After Portugal failed to qualify during the regular campaign, Ronaldo scored all four of the team\\'s goals in the play-offs against Sweden, billed as a battle between Ronaldo and Zlatan Ibrahimović, which ensured their place at the tournament. His hat-trick in the second leg took his international tally to 47 goals, equalling Pauleta\\'s record. Ronaldo subsequently scored twice in a 5–1 friendly win over Cameroon on 5 March 2014 to become his country\\'s all-time top scorer.Ronaldo took part in the tournament despite suffering from patellar tendinitis and a related thigh injury, potentially risking his career. Ronaldo later commented: \"If we had two or three Cristiano Ronaldos in the team I would feel more comfortable. But we don\\'t.\" Despite ongoing doubts over his fitness, being forced to abort practice twice, Ronaldo played the full 90 minutes of the opening match against Germany, although he was unable to prevent a 4–0 defeat. After assisting an injury-time 2–2 equaliser against the United States, he scored a late match-winning goal in a 2–1 win over Ghana. His 50th international goal made him the first Portuguese to play and score in three World Cups. Portugal were eliminated from the tournament at the close of the group stage on goal difference.\\nRonaldo scored five goals, including a hat-trick against Armenia, in the qualification for Euro 2016. With the only goal in another win over Armenia on 14 November 2014, he reached 23 goals in the UEFA European Championship, including qualifying matches, to become the competition\\'s all-time leading goalscorer. At the start of the tournament, Ronaldo failed to convert his chances in Portugal\\'s draws against Iceland and Austria, despite taking 20 shots on goal. In the latter match, he overtook Figo as Portugal\\'s most capped player with his 128th international appearance, which ended scoreless after he missed a penalty in the second half. With two goals in the last match of the group stage, a 3–3 draw against Hungary, Ronaldo became the first player to score in four European Championships, having made a record 17 appearances in the tournament. Although placed third in their group behind Hungary and Iceland, his team qualified for the knockout round as a result of the competition\\'s newly expanded format, despite not winning any of their games.In Portugal\\'s first knockout match, Ronaldo\\'s only attempt on goal was parried by Croatia\\'s goalkeeper Danijel Subašić into the path of Ricardo Quaresma, whose finish then secured a 1–0 win late in extra time. After his team progressed past Poland on penalties, with Ronaldo scoring Portugal\\'s opening penalty, he became the first player to participate in three European Championship semi-finals; he scored the opener in a 2–0 win against Wales, equalling Michel Platini as the competition\\'s all-time top scorer with nine goals. In the final against hosts France, Ronaldo was forced off after just 25 minutes following a challenge from Dimitri Payet, despite multiple treatments and attempts to play on, he was stretchered off the pitch and replaced by Quaresma. During extra time, substitute Eder scored in the 109th minute to earn Portugal a 1–0 victory. As team captain, Ronaldo lifted the trophy in celebration of his country\\'s first triumph in a major tournament. He was awarded the Silver Boot as the joint second-highest goalscorer, with three goals and three assists, and was named to the team of the tournament for the third time in his career.\\n\\n\\n=== 2016–2018: Post-European Championship victory and World Cup ===\\nFollowing the Euro 2016 success, Ronaldo played his first professional match on his home island of Madeira on 28 March 2017 at age 32, opening a 2–3 friendly defeat to Sweden at the Estádio dos Barreiros. With the goal, he tied with Miroslav Klose on 71 goals as the third-highest scoring European in international football.In Portugal\\'s opening match of the 2017 FIFA Confederations Cup against Mexico on 17 June, Ronaldo set up Quaresma\\'s opening goal in a 2–2 draw. Three days later, he scored in a 1–0 win over hosts Russia. On 24 June, he scored from a penalty in a 4–0 win over New Zealand, which saw Portugal top their group and advance to the semi-finals of the competition; with his 75th international goal, Ronaldo also equalled Sándor Kocsis as the second-highest European international goalscorer of all time, behind only Ferenc Puskás. He was named man of the match in all three of Portugal\\'s group stage matches. Ronaldo left the competition early; after Chile defeated Portugal 3–0 on penalties in the semi-finals, he was allowed to return home to be with his newborn children, and missed Portugal\\'s third-place play-off match in which Portugal defeated Mexico 2–1 after extra time.\\nOn 31 August 2017, Ronaldo scored a hat-trick in a 5–1 win in a 2018 World Cup qualifying match over the Faroe Islands, which saw him overtake Pelé and equal Hussein Saeed as the joint-fifth-highest goalscorer in international football with 78 goals. These goals brought his tally in the World Cup qualifiers to 14, equalling Predrag Mijatović\\'s record for most goals in a single UEFA qualifying campaign, and also saw him break the record for the most goals scored in a European qualifying group, overtaking the previous record of 13 goals set by David Healy and Robert Lewandowski. Ronaldo\\'s hat-trick took his World Cup qualifying goals total to 29, making him the highest scorer in UEFA qualifiers, ahead of Andriy Shevchenko, and the highest goalscorer in World Cup qualifying and finals matches combined with 32 goals, ahead of Miroslav Klose. Ronaldo later added to this tally by scoring a goal against Andorra in a 2–0 win.On 15 June 2018, Ronaldo became the oldest player to score a hat-trick in a FIFA World Cup match, helping Portugal secure a 3–3 draw against Spain (his third goal a 30-yard curling free kick with two minutes remaining) in their opening match. In doing so, he became the first Portuguese player to score a goal in four World Cups and one of four players of any nationality to do so. On 20 June, Ronaldo scored the only goal in a 1–0 win against Morocco, breaking Puskás\\' record as the highest European goalscorer of all time, with 85 international goals. In the final group match against Iran on 25 June, Ronaldo missed a penalty in an eventual 1–1 draw which saw Portugal progress to the second round as group runners-up behind Spain. On 30 June, Portugal were eliminated following a 2–1 defeat to Uruguay in the last 16. For his performances in the tournament, Ronaldo was named in the World Cup Dream Team.\\n\\n\\n=== 2018–2020: Nations League title and 100 international goals ===\\nAfter the World Cup, Ronaldo missed six international matches, including the entire league phase of the 2018–19 UEFA Nations League, but played for hosts Portugal in the inaugural Nations League Finals in June 2019. In the semi-finals on 5 June, he scored a hat-trick against Switzerland to reach the final. Upon scoring the opening goal, he became the first player to score in 10 consecutive international competitions, breaking the record he previously shared with Ghana\\'s Asamoah Gyan. In the final of the tournament four days later, Portugal defeated the Netherlands 1–0.On 10 September 2019, Ronaldo scored four goals in a 5–1 away win over Lithuania in a Euro 2020 qualifying match; in the process, he overtook Robbie Keane (23 goals) as the player with most goals in the UEFA European Championship qualifying, setting a new record with 25 goals. He also set a new record for scoring against the most national teams, 40, while also completing his eighth international hat-trick. On 14 October, he scored his 700th senior career goal for club and country from the penalty spot, in his 974th senior career appearance, a 2–1 away loss to Ukraine in a Euro 2020 qualifier. On 17 November, Ronaldo scored his 99th international goal in a 2–0 win over Luxembourg, leading Portugal to qualify for Euro 2020. On 8 September 2020, Ronaldo scored his 100th and 101st international goals in a 2–0 away win over Sweden in a 2020–21 UEFA Nations League match, becoming only the second male player ever to achieve this milestone (after Ali Daei of Iran) and the first in Europe. On 13 October, the FPF announced that Ronaldo tested positive for COVID-19 while being asymptomatic. By 30 October, Ronaldo had recovered.\\n\\n\\n=== 2021–present: All-time international appearances and top goalscorer ===\\nOn 15 June 2021, Ronaldo scored twice in Portugal\\'s first game of Euro 2020, a 3–0 win against Hungary in Budapest. This took him to a total of 11 European Championship goals, two clear of Michel Platini, as the all-time top goalscorer in the competition\\'s history. He also became the first player to score at five Euros, and in eleven consecutive tournaments. The brace made Ronaldo the oldest player to score two goals in a match in the competition, and the oldest player to score for Portugal at a major tournament. On 23 June, he scored two penalties in Portugal\\'s 2–2 draw with France in their final group stage match, equalling Daei\\'s record of 109 international goals. On 27 June, Portugal were eliminated following a 1–0 loss against Belgium in the round of 16. Ronaldo finished the tournament with five goals (tied with Czech Patrik Schick) and one assist, earning him the Golden Boot.On 1 September, Ronaldo scored two headed goals, with his second coming seconds before the full-time whistle, in a 2–1 home win against the Republic of Ireland in a World Cup qualifier at the Estádio Algarve, which saw him pass Ali Daei to become the sole record holder by breaking the men\\'s international scoring record with his 110th and 111th international goals. On 9 October, he scored the opening goal in a 3–0 friendly win over Qatar at the Estádio Algarve; with his 181st international appearance, he also overtook Sergio Ramos\\'s record for the most international caps received by a European player. In the following match against Luxembourg on 12 October, also played at the Estádio Algarve, Ronaldo scored a hat-trick in a 5–0 win for Portugal, and became the first player to score 10 hat-tricks in men\\'s international football.\\nRonaldo was named in Portugal\\'s squad for the 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar, making it his fifth World Cup. On 24 November, in Portugal\\'s opening match against Ghana, Ronaldo scored a penalty kick and became the first male player to score in five different World Cups. In the last group game against South Korea, Ronaldo received criticism from his own coach for his reaction at being substituted. He was dropped from the starting line-up for Portugal\\'s last 16 match against Switzerland, marking the first time since Euro 2008 that he had not started a game for Portugal in a major international tournament, and the first time Portugal had started a knockout game without Ronaldo in the starting line-up at an international tournament since Euro 2000. He came off the bench late on as Portugal won 6–1, their highest tally in a World Cup knockout game since the 1966 World Cup, with Ronaldo\\'s replacement Gonçalo Ramos scoring a hat-trick. Portugal employed the same strategy in the quarter-finals against Morocco, with Ronaldo once again coming off the bench; in the process, he equalled Bader Al-Mutawa\\'s international appearance record, becoming the joint–most capped male footballer of all time, with 196 caps. Portugal lost 1–0, with Morocco becoming the first CAF nation ever to reach the World Cup semi-finals.Following the World Cup, despite having his future with the national team in doubt, after rumours of a possible omission by new manager Roberto Martínez, Ronaldo was named in Portugal\\'s squad for the UEFA Euro 2024 qualifiers against Liechtenstein and Luxembourg. On 23 March, Ronaldo scored a brace in a 4–0 win over Liechtenstein; with his 197th international appearance, he overtook Al-Mutawa\\'s record and became the most capped male footballer of all time. On 20 June, Ronaldo made his 200th appearance for his national team, scoring the only goal of an away win over Iceland, in the Euro qualifiers, as he became the first player in the history of men\\'s international football to make 200 appearances for his country. On 13 October, Ronaldo scored a brace in a 3–2 win over Slovakia, leading Portugal to qualify for Euro 2024, marking the nation\\'s fastest qualification to a major tournament in their history. On 16 October, Portugal secured first place in their group, following a 5–0 away victory over Bosnia and Herzegovina, with Ronaldo scoring twice. The landmark goals saw him score in more than 100 goals in each of the last three decades (2000s, 2010s, 2020s).\\n\\n\\n== Player profile ==\\n\\n\\n=== Style of play ===\\nA versatile attacker, Ronaldo is capable of playing on either wing as well as through the centre of the pitch, and, while ostensibly right-footed, is very strong with both feet. Tactically, Ronaldo has undergone several evolutions throughout his career. While at Sporting and during his first season at Manchester United, he was typically deployed as a traditional winger on the right side of midfield, where he regularly looked to deliver crosses into the penalty area. In this position, he was able to use his pace and acceleration, agility and technical skills to take on opponents in one-on-one situations. Ronaldo became noted for his dribbling and flair, often displaying an array of tricks and feints, such as the step overs and so-called \\'chops\\' that became his trademark; he has also been known to use the flip-flap.\\nHis strength and jumping ability, combined with his elevation, heading accuracy and height of 1.87 m (6 ft 1+1⁄2 in), give him an edge in winning aerial duels. These attributes allow him to function as a target-man and make him an aerial goal threat in the penalty area; consequently, many of his goals have been headers. Allied with his increased stamina and work-rate, his goalscoring ability improved drastically on the left wing where he was given the positional freedom to move into the centre to finish attacks. He has also increasingly played a creative role for his team, often dropping deep to pick up the ball, participate in the build-up of plays and create chances for his teammates, courtesy of his vision and passing ability.In his final seasons at United, Ronaldo played an even more attacking and central role, functioning both as a striker and as a supporting forward, or even as an attacking midfielder on occasion. He developed into a prolific goalscorer, capable of finishing well both inside the penalty area and from distance with an accurate and powerful shot, courtesy of his striking ability. An accurate penalty kick taker, he also became a set piece specialist, renowned for his powerful, bending free kicks. When taking free kicks, Ronaldo is known for using the knuckleball technique, which was developed by Juninho Pernambucano. He also adopts a trademark stance before striking the ball, which involves him standing with his legs far apart. Regarding Ronaldo\\'s unique style of taking free kicks, former United assistant manager Mike Phelan commented: \"People used to put the ball down, walk away, run up and hit it. He brought in a more dynamic showmanship. He places the ball down, the concentration level is high, he takes his certain amount of steps back so that his standing foot is in the perfect place to hit the ball in the sweet spot. He is the ultimate showman. He has that slight arrogance. When he pulls those shorts up and shows his thighs, he is saying \\'All eyes on me\\' and this is going in. He understands the marketing side of it. The way he struts up and places it; the world is watching him.\"\\nAt Real Madrid, Ronaldo continued to play a more offensive role, while his creative and defensive duties became more limited, although not entirely diminished. Initially deployed as a centre forward by managers Manuel Pellegrini and José Mourinho, he was later moved back onto the left wing, though in a free tactical role; this position allowed him to drift into the centre at will to get onto the end of crosses and score, or draw out defenders with his movement off the ball and leave space for teammates to exploit. Madrid\\'s counter-attacking style of play also allowed him to become a more efficient and consistent player, as evidenced by his record-breaking goalscoring feats. While he mainly drew praise in the media for his prolific goalscoring, Ronaldo also demonstrated his ability as an effective creator in this role. This unique role has been described by pundits as that of a \"false\", \"attacking\", or \"goalscoring winger\", as Ronaldo effectively almost functioned as a striker at times with his central runs into the penalty area, despite actually playing on the left flank. From 2013 onwards, under manager Carlo Ancelotti, he effectively adapted his style to the physical effects of ageing with increasingly reduced off-the-ball movement and general involvement, completing fewer dribbles and passes per game, and instead focusing on short-distance creating and goalscoring. Since 2017, Ronaldo adapted his style of play yet again to become more of a free-roaming centre forward under manager Zinedine Zidane, a role in which he continued to excel and maintain a prolific goalscoring record; in this position, he earned praise in the media for his intelligent movement both on and off the ball, positional sense, link-up play and finishing, as well as his ability to lose or anticipate his markers, find space in the box and score from few touches or opportunities.In his first season at Juventus, Ronaldo continued to play in a variety of different attacking roles under manager Massimiliano Allegri, depending on whom he was partnered with. While he had occupied an increasingly offensive role in his final years at Real Madrid, at times he functioned in a free role at Juventus, either as a lone striker or in his trademark role on the left wing, in a 4–2–3–1 or 4–3–3 formation, in which he often switched positions with Mario Mandžukić. In this role, he was also given licence to drop deep or even out wide onto the right flank to receive the ball, and be more involved in the build-up of plays; as such, aside from scoring goals himself, he began to take on opponents and create chances for other players with greater frequency than he had in his final seasons with Real Madrid. Off the ball, he was also capable of creating space for teammates with his movement and attacking runs into the box, or finishing off chances with his head or feet by getting onto the end of his teammates\\' crosses. On occasion he also played in an attacking partnership alongside Mandžukić in a 4–3–1–2, 4–4–2, or 3–5–2 formation. He continued to play a similar role in his second season with the club under manager Maurizio Sarri.\\n\\n\\n=== Image ===\\n\\nRonaldo is widely regarded as one of the two best players of his generation, alongside Lionel Messi. Winning his first Ballon d\\'Or in 2008 by a record-high vote count at age 23, over the next decade Ronaldo has often featured in debates concerning who is the greatest player in history. Acclaimed for his prolific and consistent goal-scoring, he is considered a decisive player who is also a game changer, especially in important and high-pressured situations.\\nRonaldo is noted for his work ethic, elite body conditioning and dedication to improvement on the training pitch, as well being regarded as a natural leader. On his longevity and \"extraordinary commitment to physical preparation\", Adam Bate of Sky Sports said: \"Dedication is a huge part of staying at the top and Ronaldo\\'s focus is perhaps unparalleled within the game.\" While stating they were stylistically different players who shared an equal desire to score goals, former Brazil international Ronaldo praised Cristiano\\'s approach to training, arguing that \"there are so few players who take care of their body like he does. I trained because I had to, he does it because he loves it.\" His drive and determination to succeed are fuelled by a desire to be talked about alongside other greats such as Pelé and Diego Maradona once retiring. He is credited, along with his compatriot, coach José Mourinho, with inspiring changing fortunes of Portuguese football in 2010s and 2020s. At times, he has been criticised for simulating when tackled. He was also occasionally criticised early in his career by manager Alex Ferguson, teammates and the media for being a selfish or overly flamboyant player. Jonathan Wilson of The Guardian opined that Ronaldo had made Juventus, who he joined aged 33 in 2018, weaker, due to \"his relative immobility\" in his mid-30s, even if his personal goal-scoring output remained high.During his career, Ronaldo has also been described as having an \"arrogant image\" on the pitch, with Ronaldo stating that he had become a \"victim\" because of how he was portrayed in the media. He is often seen moaning, gesticulating and scowling while trying to inspire his team to victory, with Ronaldo insisting that his competitive nature should not be mistaken for arrogance. His managers, teammates and various journalists have said that this reputation has caused an unfair image of him.\\n\\n\\n=== Goal celebrations ===\\nRonaldo has adopted several goal celebrations throughout his career, including one particular celebration which gained widespread coverage in the media, when he squatted and stared directly into a camera on the sidelines of the pitch with his hand on his chin. After scoring a goal, he usually celebrates with a \"storming jump\" and \"turn\", before \"landing in spread-eagled fashion\" into his \"signature power stance\", while usually simultaneously exclaiming \"Sí\" (Spanish and Italian for \"yes\"). This trademark celebration has been dubbed the \"Siu\" in the media.\\n\\n\\n=== Rivalry with Lionel Messi ===\\n\\nBoth Ronaldo and Lionel Messi have scored in multiple UEFA Champions League finals and have regularly broken the 50-goal barrier in a single season. Sports journalists and pundits regularly weigh the individual merits of both players in an attempt to argue who they believe is the best player in modern football or in the history of the game. It has been compared to several sports rivalries, among them the Muhammad Ali–Joe Frazier rivalry in boxing, the Borg–McEnroe rivalry in tennis and the Senna–Prost rivalry from Formula One motor racing. Some commentators choose to analyse the differing physiques and playing styles of the two. Part of the debate revolves around the contrasting personalities of the two players, as Ronaldo is sometimes depicted as an arrogant and theatrical showoff, while Messi is portrayed as a shy, humble character.\\n\\nIn a 2012 interview, Ronaldo commented on the rivalry, saying: \"I think we push each other sometimes in the competition, this is why the competition is so high.\" Alex Ferguson, Ronaldo\\'s manager during his time at Manchester United, opined: \"I don\\'t think the rivalry against each other bothers them. I think they have their own personal pride in terms of wanting to be the best.\" Messi himself denied any rivalry, saying that it was \"only the media, the press, who wants us to be at loggerheads but I\\'ve never fought with Cristiano.\" Responding to the claims that he and Messi do not get on well on a personal level, Ronaldo commented: \"We don\\'t have a relationship outside the world of football, just as we don\\'t with a lot of other players.\" Ronaldo added that in years to come he hopes they can laugh about it together, stating: \"We have to look on this rivalry with a positive spirit, because it\\'s a good thing.\" Representing archrivals Barcelona and Real Madrid, the two players faced each other at least twice every season in the world\\'s biggest club game, El Clásico, which is among the world\\'s most viewed annual sporting events.In a debate at Oxford Union in October 2013, when asked whether FIFA president Sepp Blatter preferred Messi or Ronaldo, Blatter paid tribute to the work ethic of the Argentine before taking a swipe at Ronaldo, claiming \"one of them has more expenses for the hairdresser than the other.\" Real Madrid demanded and promptly received a full apology. In response to Blatter\\'s \"commander\" on the pitch comment, Ronaldo issued his own riposte with a mock-salute celebration after scoring a penalty against Sevilla. In August 2019, Ronaldo and Messi were interviewed while sat next to each other prior to the announcement of the UEFA Men\\'s Player of the Year, with Ronaldo stating: \"I pushed him and he pushed me as well. So it\\'s good to be part of the history of football.\"In September 2023, Ronaldo declared that his rivalry with Messi was over and \"gone\", after 36 official fixtures and 15 years of \"sharing the stage\". After Messi led Argentina to victory in the 2022 FIFA World Cup, a number of football critics, commentators and players have opined that Messi has settled the debate between the two players.\\n\\n\\n== Outside football ==\\n\\nSince his reputation grew at Manchester United, Ronaldo has signed many sponsorship deals for consumer products, including sportswear, football boots; since November 2012, Ronaldo has worn the Nike Mercurial Vapor personalised CR7 edition, soft drinks, clothing, automotive lubricants, financial services, electronics, and video games. Ronaldo featured as the cover star of FIFA video game FIFA 18 and was heavily involved in the game\\'s promotion. His \"Sii\" goal celebration features in the FIFA series, accompanied with his own voiceover. He was also the face of Pro Evolution Soccer, appearing on the covers of the 2008, 2012 and 2013 editions of the game.With earnings of €720 million (£615 million) from 2010 to 2019, Ronaldo was ranked second in Forbes list of the decade\\'s highest-paid athletes, behind boxer Floyd Mayweather Jr. Forbes twice ranked Ronaldo first on its list of the world\\'s highest-paid football players; his combined income from salaries, bonuses and endorsements was $73 million in 2013–14 and $79 million in 2014–15. The latter earnings saw him listed behind only Mayweather on the magazine\\'s list of The World\\'s Highest-Paid Athletes. In 2016, he became the first footballer to top the Forbes list of highest-earning athletes, with a total income of $88 million from his salary and endorsements in 2015–16. He topped the list for the second straight year with earnings of $93 million in 2016–17. He is the first footballer and only the third sportsman to earn $1 billion in their career. Ronaldo is one of the world\\'s most marketable sportsmen: SportsPro rated him the fifth most marketable athlete in 2012 and eighth most marketable athlete in 2013. Sports market research company Repucom named Ronaldo the most marketable and most recognised football player in the world in May 2014. He was additionally named in the 2014 Time 100, Time\\'s annual list of the most influential people in the world. ESPN named Ronaldo the world\\'s most famous athlete in 2016, 2017, 2018 and 2019.\\nRonaldo has established a strong online presence. The most popular sportsperson on social media, he counted over 500 million total followers across Facebook, Twitter and Instagram by February 2021, making him the first person to pass half a billion followers. The most-followed person on Facebook (168 million), most-followed on Instagram (615 million) and most-followed sportsperson on Twitter (109 million), his sponsors earned $936 million in media value across his accounts between June 2016 and June 2017. In December 2011, he launched an iPhone game called Heads Up with Cristiano, created by developer RockLive, and in December 2013, he launched Viva Ronaldo, a dedicated social networking website and app. Computer security company McAfee produced a 2012 report ranking footballers by the probability of an internet search for their name leading to an unsafe website, with Ronaldo\\'s name first on the list.Ronaldo\\'s autobiography, titled Moments, was published in 2007. His sponsor Castrol produced the television film Ronaldo: Tested to the Limit, in which he was physically and mentally tested in several areas; his physical performance was subject to scrutiny by world media upon the film\\'s release in September 2011. Cristiano Ronaldo: The World at His Feet, a documentary narrated by actor Benedict Cumberbatch, was released via Vimeo in June 2014. A documentary film directed by Anthony Wonke about his life and career, titled Ronaldo, was released on 9 November 2015.\\nDemand for a replica Ronaldo shirt has been high throughout his career. In 2008, Ronaldo\\'s number 7 Manchester United shirt was the best-selling Premier League sports product. In 2015, Ronaldo\\'s number 7 Real Madrid shirt was the second best-selling worldwide, after Messi\\'s number 10 Barcelona shirt. In 2018, within 24 hours of his number 7 Juventus shirt being released, over 520,000 had been sold, with $62.4 million generated in one day.Ronaldo opened a fashion boutique under the name CR7 (his initials and shirt number) on the island of Madeira in 2006 and opened a second in Lisbon in 2008. In partnership with Scandinavian manufacturer JBS Textile Group and the New York fashion designer Richard Chai, Ronaldo co-designed a range of underwear and sock line, released in November 2013. He expanded his CR7 fashion brand by launching a line of premium shirts and shoes in July 2014. In September 2015, Ronaldo released his own fragrance, \"Legacy\", in a partnership with Eden Parfums.\\nIn 2007, C.D. Nacional renamed its youth campus Cristiano Ronaldo Campus Futebol (Cristiano Ronaldo Football Campus). In December 2013, Ronaldo opened a museum, Museu CR7, in his hometown of Funchal, Madeira, to house trophies and memorabilia; the museum is an official sponsor of the local football team União da Madeira. At a ceremony held at the Belém Palace in January 2014, President of Portugal Aníbal Cavaco Silva raised Ronaldo to the rank of Grand Officer of the Order of Prince Henry \"to distinguish an athlete of world renown who has been a symbol of Portugal globally, contributing to the international projection of the country and setting an example of tenacity for future generations.\" A bronze statue of Ronaldo, designed by artist Ricardo Madeira Veloso, was unveiled in Funchal on 21 December 2014.\\nIn June 2010, during the build-up to the World Cup, Ronaldo became the fourth footballer (after Steven Gerrard, Pelé, and David Beckham) to be represented as a waxwork at Madame Tussauds London. Another waxwork of him was presented at the Madrid Wax Museum in December 2013. In June 2015, astronomers led by David Sobral from Lisbon and Leiden discovered a galaxy which they named Cosmos Redshift 7 (CR7) in tribute to Ronaldo.On 23 July 2016, following Portugal\\'s triumph at Euro 2016, Madeira Airport in Funchal was renamed as Cristiano Ronaldo International Airport. The unveiling of the rebranded terminal took place on 29 March 2017, which included a bust of his head being presented. The bust and the name change were controversial, with the lack of the bust\\'s likeness to Ronaldo being ridiculed by comedians, including Saturday Night Live, while the name change was subject to much debate locally by some politicians and citizens, who even started a petition against the move, an action criticised by President of Madeira Miguel Albuquerque. A year later, sports website Bleacher Report commissioned sculptor Emanuel Santos to create another bust; however, this bust was never used and a new one was made by a Spanish sculptor, shown to the public on 15 June 2018.On 21 September 2020, the Sporting CP\\'s football academy in Alcochete, until then called Academia Sporting, was renamed Academia Cristiano Ronaldo.Since October 26, 2023, the new owners of Medialivre (Correio da Manhã, Record and Jornal de Negócios publisher) are a group of investors that include Cristiano Ronaldo through Portuguese company Expressão Livre.In 2023, the Lisbon City Council approved awarding him, at the proposal of its president, Carlos Moedas, the Medal of Honor of the City, because he is \"a great Lisboner, in the sense of the passion he has for the city\".\\n\\n\\n=== Philanthropy ===\\nRonaldo has made contributions to various charitable causes throughout his career. Television footage of the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami showed an eight-year-old boy survivor named Martunis wearing a Portuguese football shirt who was stranded for 19 days after his family was killed. Following this, Ronaldo visited Aceh, Indonesia, to raise funds for rehabilitation and reconstruction. After accepting undisclosed damages from a libel case against The Sun newspaper in 2008, Ronaldo donated the damages to a charity in Madeira. In 2009, Ronaldo donated £100,000 to the hospital that saved his mother\\'s life in Madeira following her battle with cancer, so that they could build a cancer centre on the island. In support of the victims of the 2010 Madeira flood, Ronaldo pledged to play in a charity match in Madeira between Primeira Liga club Porto and players from Madeiran-based clubs Marítimo and Nacional.In 2012, Ronaldo and his agent paid for specialist treatment for a nine-year-old Canarian boy with apparently terminal cancer. In December 2012, Ronaldo joined FIFA\\'s \"11 for Health\" programme to raise awareness amongst kids of how to steer clear of conditions including drug addiction, HIV, malaria, and obesity. In January 2013, Ronaldo became Save the Children\\'s new Global Artist Ambassador, in which he hopes to help fight child hunger and obesity. In March 2013, Ronaldo agreed to be the ambassador for The Mangrove Care Forum in Indonesia, an organisation aiming to raise awareness of mangrove conservation.Ronaldo was named the world\\'s most charitable sportsperson in 2015 after donating £5 million to the relief effort after the earthquake in Nepal which killed over 8,000 people. In June 2016, Ronaldo donated the entirety of his €600,000 Champions League bonus after Real Madrid won the competition. In August, Ronaldo launched CR7Selfie, a selfie app for charity to help Save the Children that lets participants take a selfie with him in one of several different outfits and poses.\\n\\n\\n== Personal life ==\\n\\n\\n=== Family, children, and relationships ===\\nRonaldo has five living children. He first became a father to a son, who was born on 17 June 2010 in the United States. He has full custody of the child and has not publicly revealed the identity of the mother per an agreement with her. In January 2015, Ronaldo\\'s five-year relationship with Russian model Irina Shayk ended.Ronaldo became a father to twins, born on 8 June 2017 in the United States via surrogacy. He is currently in a relationship with Argentine-born Spanish model Georgina Rodríguez, who gave birth to a daughter on 12 November 2017. The couple expected a pair of twins in 2022. The male twin died during childbirth while the female twin survived.Ronaldo\\'s father, José, died of an alcoholism-related liver condition at age 52 in September 2005 when Ronaldo was 20.In January 2023, after Ronaldo moved to Saudi Arabia with his family having been signed by Saudi Pro League side Al Nassr, the rulers of the Muslim-leaning Kingdom made Ronaldo an exception to the rule that unmarried couples are not allowed to live together in Saudi Arabia. An unnamed Saudi lawyer told Spanish news agency EFE that \"the laws of the Kingdom still prohibit cohabitation without a marriage contract\", but Saudi authorities have begun to \"turn a blind eye and stop prosecuting anyone, even though these laws are applied when there is a problem or a crime\".Ronaldo is of Cape Verdean descent through his great-grandmother. He is a Roman Catholic.\\n\\n\\n=== Health ===\\nRonaldo has said that he does not drink alcohol, and he received libel damages over a Daily Mirror article that reported him drinking heavily in a nightclub while recovering from an injury in July 2008. He also does not have any tattoos as he regularly donates blood and bone marrow.\\n\\n\\n=== Legal issues ===\\nIn July 2017, Ronaldo was charged with fraudulently evading almost €15 million in tax between 2011 and 2014, a claim he denied at the time. In June 2018, Ronaldo was given a two-year suspended jail sentence and fined €18.8 million, later reduced to €16.8 million after reaching a deal with Spanish authorities. The sentence can be served under probation, without any jail time, so long as he does not re-offend.Ronaldo and another man were investigated by the British Crown Prosecution Service after a 2005 rape allegation was brought forward by two women. Within days, the two women withdrew their allegation and Scotland Yard later issued a statement declaring there was not enough evidence for a prosecution.In April 2017, it was reported that Ronaldo was being investigated by the Las Vegas Police Department for an allegation by a woman that he had raped her in 2009. Documents, confirmed by Ronaldo\\'s lawyers, state that Ronaldo paid a woman US$375,000 in a non-disclosure settlement. Ronaldo and his lawyers issued a lengthy statement denying all accusations, describing them as an \"intentional defamation campaign\" with parts significantly \"altered and/or completely fabricated\", a claim which Der Spiegel categorically denied. In July 2019, Las Vegas prosecutors said they would not charge Ronaldo over allegations of rape; the statement added: \"Based upon a review of information at this time, the allegations of sexual assault against Cristiano Ronaldo cannot be proven beyond a reasonable doubt.\" The same woman, in September 2018, filed a civil lawsuit in Nevada accusing Ronaldo of rape. The Daily Mirror, citing court documents, reported in 2021 that the woman sought £56 million in damages from Ronaldo. In October 2021, federal magistrate judge Daniel Albregts recommended that the lawsuit be dismissed, citing that the woman\\'s lawyer, Leslie Stovall, \"acted in bad faith by asking for, receiving, and using Football Leaks documents to prosecute\" the case, despite the documents containing \"privileged communications\" between Ronaldo and his lawyers. Additionally, Albregts stated that no evidence was found of Ronaldo\\'s lawyers having \"intimidated [the woman] or impeded law enforcement\" during the 2010 settlement with her. In June 2022, the woman\\'s rape lawsuit was dismissed with prejudice in the United States District Court for the District of Nevada, as district judge Jennifer A. Dorsey ruled that Stovall\\'s repeated use of \"cyber-hacked attorney–client privileged documents\" were actions representing \"abuses and flagrant circumvention of the proper litigation process\".\\n\\n\\n== Career statistics ==\\n\\n\\n=== Club ===\\nAs of match played 15 March 2024\\n\\n\\n=== International ===\\n\\nAs of match played 19 November 2023Notes\\n\\n\\n== Honours ==\\n\\nSporting CP\\nSupertaça Cândido de Oliveira: 2002Manchester United\\nPremier League: 2006–07, 2007–08, 2008–09\\nFA Cup: 2003–04\\nFootball League Cup: 2005–06, 2008–09\\nFA Community Shield: 2007\\nUEFA Champions League: 2007–08\\nFIFA Club World Cup: 2008Real Madrid\\nLa Liga: 2011–12, 2016–17\\nCopa del Rey: 2010–11, 2013–14\\nSupercopa de España: 2012, 2017\\nUEFA Champions League: 2013–14, 2015–16, 2016–17, 2017–18\\nUEFA Super Cup: 2014, 2017\\nFIFA Club World Cup: 2014, 2016, 2017Juventus\\nSerie A: 2018–19, 2019–20\\nCoppa Italia: 2020–21\\nSupercoppa Italiana: 2018, 2020Al Nassr\\n\\nArab Club Champions Cup: 2023Portugal\\n\\nUEFA European Championship: 2016\\nUEFA Nations League: 2018–19Individual\\n\\nBallon d\\'Or/FIFA Ballon d\\'Or: 2008, 2013, 2014, 2016, 2017\\nFIFA World Player of the Year: 2008\\nThe Best FIFA Men\\'s Player: 2016, 2017\\nThe Best FIFA Special Award for Outstanding Career Achievement: 2021\\nUEFA Club Footballer of the Year: 2007–08\\nUEFA Men\\'s Player of the Year Award: 2013–14, 2015–16, 2016–17\\nEuropean Golden Shoe: 2007–08, 2010–11, 2013–14, 2014–15\\nGolden Foot: 2020\\nFIFA Puskás Award: 2009\\nFIFA Club World Cup Golden Ball: 2016\\nUEFA European Championship Golden Boot: 2020\\nUEFA Champions League top scorer: 2007–08, 2012–13, 2013–14, 2014–15, 2015–16, 2016–17, 2017–18\\nPremier League Player of the Season: 2006–07, 2007–08\\nLa Liga Best Player: 2013–14\\nSerie A Footballer of the Year: 2019, 2020\\nPremier League Golden Boot: 2007–08\\nPichichi Trophy: 2010–11, 2013–14, 2014–15\\nCapocannoniere: 2020–21\\nPortuguese Sportsman of the Year: 2011, 2012, 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019\\nFPF Portuguese Player of the Year: 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019, 2022Orders\\n\\n Medal of Merit, Order of the Immaculate Conception of Vila Viçosa (Portuguese Royal Family)\\n Grand officer of the Order of Prince Henry\\n Commander of the Order of Merit\\nCordão Autonómico de Distinção\\n\\n\\n== See also ==\\nList of footballers with 100 or more UEFA Champions League appearances\\nList of top international men\\'s football goal scorers by country\\nList of men\\'s footballers with 100 or more international caps\\nList of men\\'s footballers with 50 or more international goals\\nList of men\\'s footballers with the most official appearances\\nList of men\\'s footballers with 500 or more goals\\n\\n\\n== Notes ==\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n\\n\\n=== Citations ===\\n\\n\\n=== Works cited ===\\nCaioli, Luca (2016) [2012].

A major figure of the New Hollywood era and pioneer of the modern blockbuster, he is the most commercially successful director in history. He is the recipient of many accolades, including three Academy Awards, two BAFTA Awards, and four Directors Guild of America Awards, as well as the AFI Life Achievement Award in 1995, the Kennedy Center Honor in 2006, the Cecil B. DeMille Award in 2009 and the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2015. Seven of his films have been inducted into the National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as \"culturally, historically or aesthetically significant\".Spielberg was born in Cincinnati, Ohio, and grew up in Phoenix, Arizona. He moved to California and studied film in college. After directing several episodes for television, including Night Gallery and Columbo, he directed the television film Duel (1971), which later received an international theatrical release. He made his theatrical film debut with The Sugarland Express (1974) and became a household name with the 1975 summer blockbuster Jaws. He directed more box office successes with Close Encounters of the Third Kind (1977), E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial (1982), and the original Indiana Jones trilogy (1981–89). He subsequently explored drama in The Color Purple (1985) and Empire of the Sun (1987).\\nIn 1993, Spielberg directed back-to-back blockbuster hits with the science fiction thriller Jurassic Park, the highest-grossing film ever at the time, and the Holocaust drama Schindler\\'s List, which has often been listed as one of the greatest films ever made. He won the Academy Award for Best Director for the latter and the 1998 World War II epic Saving Private Ryan. Spielberg has since directed the science fiction films A.I. Artificial Intelligence (2001), Minority Report (2002), and War of the Worlds (2005); the adventure films The Adventures of Tintin (2011) and Ready Player One (2018); the historical dramas Amistad (1997), Munich (2005), War Horse (2011), Lincoln (2012), Bridge of Spies (2015) and The Post (2017); the musical West Side Story (2021); and the semi-autobiographical drama The Fabelmans (2022).\\nSpielberg co-founded Amblin Entertainment and DreamWorks, and he has served as a producer for many successful films and television series, among them Poltergeist (1982), Gremlins (1984), Back to the Future (1985), Who Framed Roger Rabbit (1988) and Band of Brothers (1999). He has had a long collaboration with the composer John Williams, with whom he has worked for all but five of his feature films. Several of Spielberg\\'s works are considered among the greatest films in history, and some are among the highest-grossing films ever. In 2013, Time listed him as one of the 100 most influential people, and in 2023, Spielberg was the recipient of the first ever Time 100 Impact Award in the U.S. Reviewing Close Encounters, Pauline Kael called the young Spielberg \"a magician in the age of movies.\"\\n\\n\\n== Early life and background ==\\nSpielberg was born on December 18, 1946, in Cincinnati, Ohio. His mother, Leah (née Posner, later Adler; 1920–2017), was a restaurateur and concert pianist, and his father, Arnold Spielberg (1917–2020), was an electrical engineer involved in the development of computers. His immediate family were situationally Reform Jewish/Orthodox Jewish. Spielberg\\'s paternal grandparents were Jews from Ukraine; his grandmother Rebecca, maiden name Chechik, was from Sudylkiv, and his grandfather Shmuel Spielberg was from Kamianets-Podilskyi. Schmuel escaped to Cincinnati in 1906 to avoid being drafted into the Russian army, and he brought his fiancée Rebecca there in 1908. Spielberg has three younger sisters: Anne, Sue, and Nancy. In 1952, his family moved to Haddon Township, New Jersey after his father was hired by RCA. Spielberg attended Hebrew school from 1953 to 1957, in classes taught by Rabbi Albert L. Lewis.In early 1957, the family moved to Phoenix, Arizona. Spielberg had a bar mitzvah ceremony when he was thirteen. His family was involved in the synagogue and had many Jewish friends. Of the Holocaust, he said that his parents \"talked about it all the time, and so it was always on my mind.\" His father had lost between sixteen and twenty relatives in the Holocaust. Spielberg found it difficult accepting his heritage; he said: \"It isn\\'t something I enjoy admitting ... but when I was seven, eight, nine years old, God forgive me, I was embarrassed because we were Orthodox Jews. I was embarrassed by the outward perception of my parents\\' Jewish practices. I was never really ashamed to be Jewish, but I was uneasy at times.\" Spielberg also suffered from anti-Semitism: \"In high school, I got smacked and kicked around. Two bloody noses. It was horrible.\" He grew away from Judaism during adolescence, after his family had moved to various neighborhoods and found themselves to be the only Jews.Spielberg\\'s interest in film started at a young age. At age 12, he made his first home movie: a train wreck involving his toy Lionel trains. In 1958, he became a Boy Scout and fulfilled a requirement for the photography merit badge by making a nine-minute 8 mm film, The Last Gunfight. He eventually attained the rank of Eagle Scout. Spielberg used his father\\'s movie camera to make amateur features, and began taking the camera along on every Scout trip. At age 13, Spielberg made a 40-minute war film, Escape to Nowhere, with a cast of classmates. The film won first prize in a statewide competition. Throughout his early teens, and after entering high school, Spielberg made about fifteen to twenty 8 mm adventure films.In Phoenix, Spielberg watched films at the local theater every Saturday. Some of the films he cited as early influences include Ishirō Honda and Eiji Tsuburaya\\'s Godzilla, King of the Monsters! (1956), Akira Kurosawa\\'s films, Captains Courageous (1937), Pinocchio (1940), and David Lean\\'s Lawrence of Arabia (1962), which he called \"the film that set me on my journey\". He attended Arcadia High School in 1961 for three years. He wrote and directed his first independent film in 1963, a 140-minute science fiction adventure, Firelight, which later inspired Close Encounters of The Third Kind. The film, funded mainly by his father, had a budget of under $600, and was shown in a local theater for one evening. In the summer of 1964, he worked as an unpaid assistant at Universal Studios\\' editorial department. His family later moved to Saratoga, California, where he attended Saratoga High School, graduating in 1965. A year later, his parents divorced. Spielberg moved to Los Angeles to stay with his father, while his three sisters and mother remained in Saratoga. He was not interested in academics, aspiring only to be a filmmaker. He applied to the University of Southern California\\'s film school but was turned down because of his mediocre grades. He then applied and enrolled at California State University, Long Beach, where he became a brother of Theta Chi Fraternity.After taking a tour bus to Universal Studios, a chance conversation with an executive led to Spielberg getting a three-day pass to the premises, allowing him to come back the next day. On the fourth day he walked up to the studio gates without a pass, and the security guard waved him in: \"I basically spent the next two months at Universal Studios. And that was how I became an unofficial apprentice that summer.\"In 1968, Universal gave Spielberg the opportunity to write and direct a short film for theatrical release, the 26-minute 35 mm Amblin\\'. Studio vice president Sidney Sheinberg was impressed by the film, and offered Spielberg a seven-year directing contract. A year later, he dropped out of college to begin directing television productions for Universal. It made him the youngest director to be signed to a long-term plan with a major Hollywood studio. Spielberg returned to Long Beach in 2002, where he presented his own film Schindler\\'s List to complete his Bachelor of Arts in Film and Electronic Media.\\n\\n\\n== Career ==\\n\\n\\n=== 1969–1974: Early film and television work ===\\nSpielberg\\'s professional debut was directing segments for the 1969 pilot episode of Night Gallery, scripted by Rod Serling and featuring Joan Crawford. Initially, there was skepticism from Crawford and studio executives regarding Spielberg\\'s inexperience. Despite Spielberg\\'s efforts to implement advanced camerawork techniques, studio executives demanded a more straightforward approach. His initial contributions received mixed responses, leading Spielberg to briefly step back from studio work.Joan Crawford, reflecting on her collaboration with Spielberg, recognized his potential, noting his unique intuitive inspiration compared to more seasoned directors. She expressed her appreciation for Spielberg\\'s talent in a note to him and also communicated her approval to Rod Serling, emphasizing Spielberg\\'s promising future in the industry. Crawford\\'s endorsement highlighted Spielberg\\'s early recognition in Hollywood despite initial hesitations regarding his experience.In the early 1970s, Spielberg unsuccessfully tried to raise financing for his own low-budget films. He turned to writing screenplays with other writers, and then directing television episodes. These included the series Marcus Welby, M.D., The Name of the Game (\"L.A. 2017\"), Columbo, Owen Marshall, Counselor at Law and The Psychiatrist. Although unsatisfied with this work, Spielberg used the opportunity to experiment with his techniques and learn about filmmaking. He earned good reviews and impressed producers; he was earning a steady income and relocated to Laurel Canyon, Los Angeles.\\nBased on the strength of his work, Universal signed Spielberg to do four television films. The first was Duel (1971), adapted from Richard Matheson\\'s short story of the same name, about a salesman (Dennis Weaver) being chased down a highway by a psychotic tanker truck driver. Impressed with the film, executives decided to promote it on television. Reviews were  positive, and Universal asked Spielberg to shoot more scenes so that Duel could be released to international markets. \"Deservedly so\" writes David Thomson, \"for it stands up as one of the medium\\'s most compelling spirals of suspense.\" More TV films followed: Something Evil (1972) and Savage (1973).\\nIn 1974, Spielberg made his theatrical debut, The Sugarland Express, based on a true story about a married couple on the run, desperate to regain custody of their baby from foster parents.  The film starred Goldie Hawn and William Atherton and marked the first of many collaborations with the composer John Williams. Although the film was awarded Best Screenplay at the 1974 Cannes Film Festival, it was not a commercial success,  which Spielberg blamed on Universal\\'s inconsistent marketing.  The film opened in four hundred theaters in the U.S. to positive reviews; Pauline Kael wrote \"Spielberg uses his gifts in a very free-and-easy, American way—for humor, and for a physical response to action. He could be that rarity among directors, a born entertainer—perhaps a new generation\\'s Howard Hawks.\" The Hollywood Reporter wrote that \"a major new director is on the horizon.\"\\n\\n\\n=== 1975-1980: Breakthrough ===\\nProducers Richard D. Zanuck and David Brown took a chance with Spielberg, and gave him the opportunity to direct Jaws (1975), a horror-thriller based on the Peter Benchley novel of the same name. In it, a great white shark attacks beachgoers at a summer resort town, prompting police chief Martin Brody (Roy Scheider) to hunt it down with the help of a marine biologist (Richard Dreyfuss) and a veteran shark hunter (Robert Shaw). Jaws was the first movie shot on open ocean, so shooting proved difficult, and the mechanical shark malfunctioned. The filming schedule overran by a hundred days, and Universal threatened to cancel production. Against expectations, Jaws was a success; it set the domestic box office record, making Spielberg a household name. It won Academy Awards for Best Film Editing, Best Original Dramatic Score, and Best Sound. Spielberg said the malfunctioning of the mechanical shark resulted in a better movie, as he had to find ways to suggest the shark without showing it. After seeing the unconventional camera techniques of Jaws, Alfred Hitchcock praised \"young Spielberg\" for thinking outside the visual dynamics of the theater: \"He\\'s the first one of us who doesn\\'t see the proscenium arch\".After the success of Jaws, Spielberg declined an offer to make Jaws 2. He and Richard Dreyfuss re-convened to work on a film about UFOs, Close Encounters of the Third Kind (1977). During filming, Spielberg used 65 mm film for the best picture quality, and a new live-action recording system so that the recordings could be duplicated later. He cast one of his favorite directors, François Truffaut, as the scientist Claude Lacombe. One of the rare films both written and directed by Spielberg, Close Encounters was very popular with film-goers, and he received his first Best Director nomination from the Academy Awards. It earned six more nominations, winning Best Cinematography and Best Sound Effects Editing. Stanley Kauffmann wrote: \"I saw Close Encounters at its first public showing in New York, and most of the audience stayed on and on to watch the credits crawl lengthily at the end. For one thing, under the credits the giant spaceship was returning to the stars. For another, they just didn’t want to leave this picture. For still another, they seemed to understand the importance of those many names to what they had just seen.\" Kauffmann placed it first on his list of the best American films from 1968–1977.Spielberg\\'s first film as an executive producer was the directorial debut of Robert Zemeckis, I Wanna Hold Your Hand (1978). His next directorial work was 1941 (1979), an action-comedy written by  Zemeckis and Bob Gale about Californians preparing for a Japanese invasion after the attack on Pearl Harbor. Spielberg was self-conscious about doing comedy as he had no prior experience in the genre. Universal and Columbia agreed to co-finance the film. 1941 grossed over $92.4 million worldwide upon release, but most critics, and the studio heads, disliked it. Charles Champlin described 1941 as \"the most conspicuous waste since the last major oil spill, which it somewhat resembles.\"  Stanley Kubrick supposedly said that the film was \"great, but not funny.\"\\n\\n\\n=== 1981–1990: Stardom ===\\nSpielberg produced Used Cars (Zemeckis, 1980), which was a critical but not a commercial success. He directed Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981), with a screenplay by Lawrence Kasdan based on a story by George Lucas and Philip Kaufman. They considered it an homage to the serials of the 1930s and 1940s. It starred Karen Allen as Marion Ravenwood and Harrison Ford as Indiana Jones. Filmed in La Rochelle, Hawaii, Tunisia and Elstree Studios, England, the shoot was difficult but Spielberg said it helped him hone his business acumen. The film was a box office success and won Academy Awards for Best Art Direction (Norman Reynolds, Leslie Dilley, and Michael D. Ford); Best Film Editing (Michael Kahn); Best Sound (Bill Varney, Steve Maslow, Gregg Landaker, and Roy Charman); Best Sound Editing (Ben Burtt and Richard L. Anderson); and Best Visual Effects (Richard Edlund, Kit West, Bruce Nicholson, and Joe Johnston). Roger Ebert wrote that \"Raiders of the Lost Ark is an out-of-body experience, a movie of glorious imagination and breakneck speed that grabs you in the first shot, hurtles you through a series of incredible adventures, and deposits you back in reality two hours later -- breathless, dizzy, wrung-out, and with a silly grin on your face... For locations, it ticks off the jungles of South America, the hinterlands of Tibet, the deserts of Egypt, a hidden submarine base, an isolated island, a forgotten tomb -- no, make that two forgotten tombs -- and an American archaeology classroom. For villains, it has sadistic Nazis, slimy gravediggers, drunken Sherpas, and scheming Frenchmen. For threats, it climaxes with the wrath of God, and leads up to that spectacular development by easy stages, with tarantulas, runaway boulders, hidden spears, falling rock slabs, burning airplanes, runaway trucks, sealed tombs, and snakes. Lots of snakes.\" Raiders was the first film in the Indiana Jones franchise.\\nIn 1982, Spielberg returned to science fiction with E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial. It tells the story of Elliot (Henry Thomas), a young boy who befriends an alien who was accidentally left behind by his companions and is attempting to return home. Spielberg eschewed storyboards so that his direction would be more spontaneous, and shot roughly in sequence so that the actors\\' performances would be authentic as they bonded with and said goodbye to E.T. E.T. premiered at the 1982 Cannes Film Festival to an ecstatic reaction; producer Kathleen Kennedy recalled, \"You couldn\\'t hear the end of the movie because people were on their feet stomping and yelling [...] It was one of the most amazing experiences.\" A special screening was organized for Ronald and Nancy Reagan, who were emotional by the end. E.T. grossed $700 million worldwide. It won four Academy Awards: Best Original Score (John Williams), Best Sound (Robert Knudson, Robert Glass, Don Digirolamo, and Gene Cantamessa), Best Sound Editing (Charles L. Campbell and Ben Burtt), and Best Visual Effects (Carlo Rambaldi, Dennis Muren, and Kenneth F. Smith). It was nominated for Best Picture but lost to Gandhi; its director, Richard Attenborough, said, \"I was certain that not only would E.T. win, but that it should win. It was inventive, powerful, wonderful. I make more mundane movies.\" Pauline Kael wrote of E.T.: \"His voice is ancient and otherworldly but friendly, humorous. And this scaly, wrinkled little man with huge, wide-apart, soulful eyes and a jack-in-the-box neck has been so fully created that he\\'s a friend to us, too; when he speaks of his longing to go home the audience becomes as mournful as Elliot. Spielberg has earned the tears that some people in the audience—and not just children—shed. The tears are tokens of gratitude for the spell the picture has put on the audience. Genuinely entrancing movies are almost as rare as extraterrestrial visitors.\" Spielberg co-wrote and produced Poltergeist (1982) and directed the \"Kick The Can\" segment in Twilight Zone: The Movie.\\nHis next directorial work was the Raiders of the Lost Ark prequel Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom (1984). Working again with Lucas and Ford, the film was shot in the United States, Sri Lanka and China. The film was darker than its predecessor, and led to the creation of the PG-13 rating because some content was deemed unsuitable for children under 13. Spielberg later said that he was unhappy with Temple of Doom because it lacked his \"personal touches and love\". Nonetheless, the film was a blockbuster hit, won the Academy Award for Best Special Effects and received mostly good reviews. Kael preferred it to the original, writing: \"Spielberg is like a magician whose tricks are so daring they make you laugh. He creates an atmosphere of happy disbelief: the more breathtaking and exhilarating the stunts are the funnier they are. Nobody has ever fused thrills and laughter in quite the way that he does here. He starts off at full charge in the opening sequence and just keeps going.\" She conceded that it was less \"sincere\" than Raiders, adding \"that\\'s what is so good about it.\" It was on this project that Spielberg met his future wife, Kate Capshaw, who played Willie Scott.  Spielberg recalled, \"The second film I could have done a lot better if there had been a different story. It was a good learning exercise for me to really throw myself into a black hole. I came out of the darkness of Temple Of Doom and I entered the light of the woman I was eventually going to marry and raise a family with.\"David Thomson writes that \"At first sight, the Spielberg of the eighties may seem more an impresario—or a studio, even—then a director.\" In 1984, Spielberg, Kennedy and Frank Marshall  founded production company Amblin Entertainment. Between 1984 and 1990, Spielberg served as either producer or executive producer on nineteen feature films, among them Gremlins (Joe Dante, 1984), Back to the Future (Zemeckis, 1985), The Goonies (Richard Donner, 1985), Who Framed Roger Rabbit (Zemeckis, 1988), Joe Versus the Volcano (John Patrick Shanley, 1990), Arachnophobia (Marshall, 1990) and Cape Fear (Martin Scorsese, 1991). For some films, such as Harry and the Hendersons and Young Sherlock Holmes, the title \"Steven Spielberg Presents\" was in the opening credits. Much of Spielberg\\'s producing work was aimed at children and teens, including cartoons such as Tiny Toon Adventures, Animaniacs, Pinky and the Brain, Freakazoid!, and Family Dog. Spielberg also produced Don Bluth\\'s animated features An American Tail and The Land Before Time. In 1985, NBC offered Spielberg a two-year contract on a television series, Amazing Stories; the show was marketed as a blend of The Twilight Zone and Alfred Hitchcock Presents. NBC gave Spielberg creative control and a budget of $1 million for each episode. After two seasons and disappointing ratings, the show was not renewed. Although Spielberg\\'s involvement as a producer would vary widely from project to project, Zemeckis said that Spielberg would always \"respect the filmmaker\\'s vision\". Over the next decade, Spielberg\\'s record as a producer brought mixed critical and commercial results. In 1992, Spielberg began to scale back producing, saying \"Producing has been the least fulfilling aspect of what I\\'ve done in the last decade.\"In the early 1980s, Spielberg befriended Warner Communications CEO Steve Ross, which eventually resulted in him making films for Warner Bros. This started with The Color Purple (1985), an adaptation of Alice Walker\\'s Pulitzer Prize-winning novel of the same name, about a generation of empowered African-American women during depression-era America. It was Spielberg\\'s first film on a dramatic subject matter, and he expressed reservations about tackling the project: \"It\\'s the risk of being judged-and accused of not having the sensibility to do character studies.\" Starring Whoopi Goldberg and Oprah Winfrey, the film was a box office hit and critics started to take note of Spielberg\\'s foray into drama. Ebert named it the best film of the year. The film also received eleven Academy Award nominations, and Spielberg won Best Director from the Directors Guild of America. The film was produced and scored by Quincy Jones.\\nAs China underwent economic reform and opened up to the American film industry, Spielberg made Empire of the Sun (1987), the first American film shot in Shanghai since the 1930s. It is an adaptation of J. G. Ballard\\'s autobiographical novel of the same name about Jamie Graham (Christian Bale), a young boy who goes from being the son of a wealthy British family in Shanghai to a prisoner of war in a Japanese internment camp during World War II. Critical reaction was mixed at the time of release; criticism ranged from the \"overwrought\" plot to Spielberg\\'s downplaying of \"disease and starvation\". However, Andrew Sarris named it the best film of the year and later included it among the best of the decade. The film was nominated for six Academy Awards, but was a disappointment at the box office; Ian Alterman of The New York Times thought it was overlooked by audiences. Spielberg recalled that Empire of the Sun was one of his most enjoyable films to make.After directing The Color Purple and Empire of the Sun, Spielberg intended to direct Rain Man, but instead directed Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade (1989) to meet his contractual obligations. Producer Lucas and star Ford returned for the film. A longtime James Bond fan, Spielberg cast Sean Connery as Jones\\'s father, Henry Jones, Sr. Due to complaints about violence in Temple of Doom, Spielberg toned down the darkness for the third installment. Last Crusade received mostly positive reviews and was a box office success, earning $474 million; it was his biggest hit since E.T. Biographer Joseph McBride wrote that it was a comeback for Spielberg, and Spielberg acknowledged the amount he has learned from making the Indiana Jones series. Ebert wrote that \"If there is just a shade of disappointment after seeing this movie, it has to be because we will never again have the shock of this material seeming new. Raiders of the Lost Ark, now more than ever, seems a turning point in the cinema of escapist entertainment, and there was really no way Spielberg could make it new all over again. What he has done is to take many of the same elements, and apply all of his craft and sense of fun to make them work yet once again. And they do.\"\\nAlso in 1989, he reunited with Richard Dreyfuss for the romantic drama Always, about an  aerial firefighter. It is a modern remake of one of Spielberg\\'s favorite childhood films, A Guy Named Joe (1943). The story was personal; he said \"As a child I was very frustrated, and maybe I saw my own parents [in A Guy Named Joe]. I was also short of girlfriends. And it stuck with me.\" Spielberg had discussed the film with Dreyfuss back in 1975, with up to twelve drafts being written before filming commenced. Always was commercially unsuccessful and received mixed reviews. Janet Maslin of The New York Times wrote, \"Always is filled with big, sentimental moments, it lacks the intimacy to make any of this very moving.\"\\n\\n\\n=== 1991–1998: Established career ===\\nAfter a brief setback in which Spielberg felt \"artistically stalled\", he returned in 1991 with Hook, about a middle-aged Peter Pan (Robin Williams), who returns to Neverland and encounters Tinker Bell (Julia Roberts) and the eponymous Captain Hook (Dustin Hoffman). During filming, the stars clashed on set; Spielberg told 60 Minutes that he would never work with Roberts again. Nominated for five Academy Awards, the studio enjoyed the film but most critics did not; Thomson called it \"maudlin.\" Writing for The Washington Post, Desson Howe described the film as \"too industrially organized\", and thought it mundane. At the box office, it earned over $300 million worldwide from a $70 million budget. In 1993, Spielberg served as an executive producer for the NBC science fiction series seaQuest DSV; the show was not a hit. In 1994, he found success producing the medical drama ER.In 1993, Spielberg returned to the adventure genre with Jurassic Park, based on the 1990 novel of the same name by Michael Crichton (creator of ER), with a screenplay by Crichton and David Koepp. Jurassic Park is set on a fictional island near Costa Rica, where a businessman (Richard Attenborough) has hired a team of geneticists to create a wildlife park of de-extinct dinosaurs. In a departure from his usual order of planning, Spielberg and the designers storyboarded certain sequences from the novel early on. The film also used computer-generated imagery provided by Industrial Light & Magic; Jurassic Park was completed on time and became the highest-grossing film at the time, and won three Academy Awards. The film\\'s dominance during its theatrical run, as well as Spielberg\\'s $250 million salary, made him self-conscious of his own success.\\nAlso in 1993, Spielberg directed Schindler\\'s List, about Oskar Schindler, a businessman who helped save 1,100 Jews from the Holocaust. Based on Schindler\\'s Ark by Australian novelist Thomas Keneally, Spielberg waited ten years to make the film as he did not feel \"mature\" enough. He wanted to embrace his heritage, and after the birth of his son, Max, he said that \"it greatly affected me [...] A spirit began to ignite in me, and I became a Jewish dad\". Filming commenced on March 1, 1993, in Poland, while Spielberg was still editing Jurassic Park in the evenings. To make filming \"bearable\", Spielberg brought his wife and children with him. While Schindler\\'s List was praised by most critics, some reviewers, including filmmaker Claude Lanzmann, criticized the film for its weak representation of the Holocaust. Imre Kertész, a Hungarian author and concentration camp survivor, also disliked the film, saying, \"I regard as kitsch any representation of the Holocaust that is incapable of understanding or unwilling to understand the organic connection between our own deformed mode of life and the very possibility of the Holocaust.\" Against expectations, the film was a commercial success, and Spielberg used his percentage of profits to start the Shoah Foundation, a non-profit organization that archives testimonies of Holocaust survivors. Schindler\\'s List won seven Academy Awards, including Best Picture, and Spielberg\\'s first as Best Director. It also won seven BAFTAs, and three Golden Globes. According to the American Film Institute, Schindler\\'s List is one of the 100 best American films ever made.In 1994, Spielberg took a break from directing to spend more time with his family, and set up his new film studio, DreamWorks, with Jeffrey Katzenberg and David Geffen. Spielberg cited more creative control and distribution improvements as the main reasons for founding his own studio; he and his partners compared themselves to the founders of United Artists back in 1919. DreamWorks\\' investors included Microsoft founders Paul Allen and Bill Gates. After founding DreamWorks, Spielberg continued to operate Amblin Entertainment and direct films for other studios. Besides film, Spielberg helped design a Jurassic Park-themed attraction at Universal Orlando in Florida. The workload of filmmaking and operating a studio raised questions about his commitments, but Spielberg maintained that \"this is all fitting nicely into my life and I\\'m still home by six and I\\'m still home on the weekends.\"After his hiatus, he returned to directing with a sequel to Jurassic Park, The Lost World: Jurassic Park (1997). A loose adaptation of Michael Crichton\\'s novel The Lost World, the plot follows mathematician Ian Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum) and his researchers who study dinosaurs at a Jurassic Park island, and are confronted by another team with a different agenda. This time, Spielberg wanted the onscreen creatures to be more realistic than in the first film; he used 3D storyboards, computer imagery and robotic puppets. Budgeted at $73 million, The Lost World: Jurassic Park opened in May 1997 and was one of the highest grossing films of the year. The Village Voice critic opined that The Lost World was \"better crafted but less fun\" that the first film, while The Guardian wrote \"It looks like a director on autopilot [...] The special effects brook no argument.\"His 1997 feature Amistad his first released under DreamWorks, was based on the true story of the events in 1839 aboard the slave ship La Amistad. Producer Debbie Allen, who had read the book Amistad I in 1978, thought Spielberg would be perfect to direct. Spielberg was hesitant taking on the project, afraid that it would be compared to Schindler\\'s List, but he said, \"I\\'ve never planned my career [...] In the end I do what I think I gotta do.\" Starring Morgan Freeman, Anthony Hopkins, Djimon Hounsou and Matthew McConaughey, Spielberg used Allen\\'s ten years worth of research to reenact the difficult historical scenes. The film struggled to find an audience, and underperformed at the box office; Spielberg admitted that \"[Amistad] became too much of a history lesson.\"\\nSpielberg\\'s 1998 release was World War II epic Saving Private Ryan, about a group of U.S. soldiers led by Captain Miller (Tom Hanks) sent to bring home a paratrooper whose three older brothers were killed in the same twenty-four hours of the Normandy landing. Filming took place in England, and U.S. Marine Dale Dye was hired to train the actors and keep them in character during the combat scenes. Halfway through filming, Spielberg reminded the cast that they were making a tribute to thank \"your grandparents and my dad, who fought in [the war]\". Upon release, critics praised the direction and its realistic portrayal of war. The film grossed a successful $481 million worldwide, and Spielberg won a second Academy Award for Best Director. In August 1999, Spielberg and Hanks were awarded the Distinguished Public Service Medal from Secretary of Defense William S. Cohen. Roger Ebert wrote \"Spielberg knows how to make audiences weep better than any director since Chaplin in City Lights. But weeping is an incomplete response, letting the audience off the hook. This film embodies ideas. After the immediate experience begins to fade, the implications remain and grow.\"\\n\\n\\n=== 1999–2012: Career expansion ===\\nIn 2001, Spielberg and Tom Hanks produced Band of Brothers, a  ten-part HBO miniseries based on Stephen Ambrose\\'s book of the same name. It follows Easy Company of the 101st Airborne Division\\'s 506th Parachute Infantry Regiment. The series won a Golden Globe for Best Miniseries. That same year, Spielberg returned to science fiction with A.I. Artificial Intelligence, a loose adaptation of Brian Aldiss\\'s 1969 short story \"Supertoys Last All Summer Long\". Stanley Kubrick had first asked Spielberg to direct the feature in 1979. Spielberg tried to make it in the style that Kubrick would have, though with mixed results according to some critics. The plot revolves around an android, David (Haley Joel Osment) who, like Pinocchio, dreams of being a \"real boy\". Critics thought Spielberg directed with \"sentimentality\", and Roger Ebert wrote, \"Here is one of the most ambitious films of recent years [...] but it miscalculates in asking us to invest our emotions in a character, a machine.\" The film won five Saturn Awards, and grossed $236 million worldwide. Jonathan Rosenbaum highly praised the film: \"If the best movies are often those that change the rules, Steven Spielberg’s sincere, cockeyed, serious, and sometimes masterful realization of Stanley Kubrick’s ambitious late project deserves to be a contender... If A.I. Artificial Intelligence — a film whose split personality is apparent even in its two-part title — is as much a Kubrick movie as a Spielberg one, this is in large part because it defamiliarizes Spielberg, makes him strange. Yet it also defamiliarizes Kubrick, with equally ambiguous results — making his unfamiliarity familiar. Both filmmakers should be credited for the results — Kubrick for proposing that Spielberg direct the project and Spielberg for doing his utmost to respect Kubrick’s intentions while making it a profoundly personal work.\" A. O. Scott called it \"the best fairy tale -- the most disturbing, complex and intellectually challenging boy\\'s adventure story -- Mr. Spielberg has made\" and chose it as the best film of the year.Spielberg followed A.I. with the sci-fi neo-noir Minority Report (2002), based on Philip K. Dick\\'s the short story of the same name about a group of investigators who try to prevent crimes before they are committed. The film received critical acclaim. Ebert named Minority Report the best film of 2002, praising its craftsmanship: \"here is Spielberg using every trick in the book and matching them without seams, so that no matter how he\\'s achieving his effects, the focus is always on the story and the characters...Some directors place their trust in technology. Spielberg, who is a master of technology, trusts only story and character, and then uses everything else as a workman uses his tools.\" However, critic Todd McCarthy thought there was not enough action. The film earned over $358 million worldwide. That same year, he released Catch Me If You Can, based on the book of the same name by con-artist Frank Abagnale. Leonardo DiCaprio played Abangale; Christopher Walken and Tom Hanks also starred. Spielberg said, \"I have always loved movies about sensational rogues—they break the law, but you just have to love them for the moxie.\" The film was a critical and commercial success.Spielberg worked with Hanks, Catherine Zeta-Jones and Stanley Tucci in 2004\\'s The Terminal, a lighthearted comedy about an Eastern European man stranded in an airport. The film was praised for its production design and was a commercial success, although reviews were mixed. In 2005, Spielberg directed War of the Worlds, a co-production of Paramount and DreamWorks, based on H. G. Wells\\'s novel of the same name; Spielberg had been a fan of the book and of George Pal\\'s 1953 film. Starring Tom Cruise and Dakota Fanning, the film follows an American dock worker who is forced to look after his children, from whom he lives separately, as he tries to protect and reunite them with their mother when extraterrestrials invade Earth. Spielberg used storyboards to help the actors react to computer imagery that they could not see and used natural lighting and camerawork to avoid an \"over stylized\" science fiction picture. Upon release, the film was a box office hit, grossing over $600 million worldwide.Spielberg\\'s Munich (2005) is about the Israeli government\\'s secret retaliation after eleven Israeli Olympic athletes were kidnapped and murdered in the 1972 Munich massacre. The film is based on Vengeance, a book by Canadian journalist George Jonas. It was previously adapted for the screen in the 1986 television film Sword of Gideon. Spielberg, who personally remembers the incident, sought advice from former president Bill Clinton, among others, before making the film because he did not want to cause further problems in the Middle East. Although the film garnered mostly positive reviews, some critics perceived it as anti-Semitic; it is one of Spielberg\\'s most controversial films to date. Munich received five Academy Awards nominations: Best Picture, Best Film Editing, Best Score, Best Adapted Screenplay, and Best Director for Spielberg. It was his sixth Best Director nomination, and fifth Best Picture nomination.In the mid-2000s, Spielberg scaled down his directing career and became more selective about film projects to undertake. In December 2005, Spielberg and his partners sold DreamWorks to media conglomerate Viacom (now known as Paramount Global). The sale was finalized in February 2006. In June 2006, Spielberg planned to make Interstellar, but abandoned the project, which was eventually directed by Christopher Nolan. During this period, Spielberg remained active as a producer; producing 2005\\'s Memoirs of a Geisha, an adaptation of Arthur Golden\\'s novel of the same name. Spielberg and Robert Zemeckis executive-produced the animated film Monster House (2006), marking their eighth collaboration. He also worked with Clint Eastwood for the first time, co-producing 2006\\'s Flags of Our Fathers and Letters from Iwo Jima with Robert Lorenz. Spielberg served as executive producer for 2007\\'s Disturbia, and the Transformers film series. In that same year, Spielberg and Mark Burnett co-produced On the Lot, a reality and competition show about filmmaking.Spielberg returned to the Indiana Jones series in 2008 with the fourth installment, Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull. Released nineteen years after Last Crusade, the film is set in 1957, pitting Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford) against Soviet agents led by Irina Spalko (Cate Blanchett), searching for a telepathic crystal skull. Principal photography was complete in October 2007, and the film was released on May 22, 2008. This was his first film not released by DreamWorks since 1997. The film received generally favorable reviews from critics, but some fans were disappointed by the introduction of science fiction elements which were uncharacteristic of the previous films. Writing for The Age, Tom Ryan praised Spielberg and George Lucas for their realistic 1950s setting—\"The energy on display is impressive\". It was a box office success, grossing $790 million worldwide.\\nIn early 2009, Spielberg shot the first film in a planned trilogy of motion capture films based on Hergé\\'s The Adventures of Tintin. The Adventures of Tintin: The Secret of the Unicorn was co-produced by Peter Jackson and premiered in Brussels, Belgium. The film was released in North American theaters on December 21, in Digital 3D and IMAX. It received generally positive reviews from critics and grossed over $373 million worldwide. The Adventures of Tintin won Best Animated Feature at the 69th Golden Globe Awards. It was the first non-Pixar film to win the award since the category was introduced.Spielberg followed Tintin with War Horse, shot in England in the summer of 2010. It was released four days after Tintin, on December 25, 2011. The film is based on  Michael Morpurgo\\'s 1982 novel of the same name and follows the long friendship between a British boy and his horse Joey before and during World War I. Distributed by Walt Disney Studios, with whom DreamWorks made a distribution deal in 2009, War Horse was the first of four consecutive Spielberg films released by Disney. War Horse had an acclaimed response from critics, and was nominated for six Academy Awards, including Best Picture. In his review for Salon magazine, Andrew O\\'Hehir wrote, \"at this point in his career Spielberg is pursuing personal goals, and everything that\\'s terrific and overly flat and tooth-rottingly sweet about War Horse reflects that.\"Spielberg returned to the World War II theme, co-producing the 2010 miniseries The Pacific with Tom Hanks and Gary Goetzman. The miniseries is centered on the battles in the Pacific Theater. The following year, Spielberg co-created Falling Skies, a science fiction series on TNT, with Robert Rodat. Spielberg also produced the 2011 Fox series Terra Nova. Terra Nova begins in the year 2149 when all life on the planet Earth is threatened with extinction resulting in scientists opening a door that allows people to travel back 85 million years to prehistoric times. In that same year, he produced J. J. Abrams\\'s Super 8.\\nSpielberg directed the historical drama Lincoln (2012), starring Daniel Day-Lewis as President Abraham Lincoln and Sally Field as Mary Todd Lincoln. Based on Doris Kearns Goodwin\\'s book Team of Rivals: The Political Genius of Abraham Lincoln and written by Tony Kushner, the film depicts the final four months of Lincoln\\'s life. The film was shot in Richmond, Virginia in late 2011, and was released in the U.S. in November 2012. Lincoln was acclaimed and earned more than $250 million worldwide. It was nominated for twelve Academy Awards, including Best Picture and Best Director, winning Best Production Design and Best Actor for Day-Lewis\\'s performance. Donald Clarke from The Irish Times praised the direction: \"Against the odds, Spielberg makes something genuinely exciting of the backstage wheedling.\"\\n\\n\\n=== 2013–present: Recent work ===\\nIt was announced on May 2, 2013, that Spielberg would direct American Sniper, but he left the project before production began. Instead, he directed 2015\\'s Bridge of Spies, a Cold War thriller based on the 1960 U-2 incident, and focusing on James B. Donovan\\'s negotiations with the Soviets for the release of pilot Gary Powers after his aircraft was shot down over Soviet territory. The screenplay was by the Coen brothers, and the film starred Tom Hanks as Donovan, as well as Mark Rylance, Amy Ryan, and Alan Alda. It was filmed in the fall of 2014 in New York City, Berlin and Wroclaw, and was released on October 16. Bridge of Spies was popular with critics, and was nominated for six Academy Awards, including Best Picture; Rylance won Best Supporting Actor, becoming the second actor to win for a performance directed by Spielberg.In 2016, Spielberg made The BFG, an adaptation of Roald Dahl\\'s children\\'s book, starring newcomer Ruby Barnhill, and Mark Rylance as the titular Big Friendly Giant. DreamWorks bought the rights in 2010, and John Madden had intended to direct. The film was the last to be written by E.T. screenwriter Melissa Mathison before her death. It was co-produced and released by Walt Disney Pictures, marking the first Disney-branded film to be directed by Spielberg. The BFG premiered as an out-of-competition entry at the 2016 Cannes Film Festival, and received a wide release in the U.S. on July 1, 2016. The BFG welcomed fair reviews; Michael Phillips of Chicago Tribune compared certain scenes to the works of Alfred Hitchcock and Stanley Kubrick, while Toronto Sun\\'s Liz Braun thought that there were \"moments of wonder and delight\" but it was too long.A year later, Spielberg directed The Post, an account of The Washington Post\\'s printing of the Pentagon Papers. Starring Tom Hanks and Meryl Streep, production began in New York on May 30, 2017. Spielberg stated his attraction to the project: \"When I read the first draft of the script, this wasn\\'t something that could wait three years or two years—this was a story I felt we needed to tell today.\" The film received a wide release on January 12, 2018. The Post gained positive reception; the critic from the Associated Press thought \"Spielberg infuses every scene with tension and life and the grandeur of the ordinary that he\\'s always been so good at conveying.\" In 2017, Spielberg and other filmmakers were featured in the Netflix documentary series Five Came Back, which discussed the contributions of directors Frank Capra, John Ford, John Huston, George Stevens and William Wyler, about their war-related works. Spielberg also served as an executive producer.\\nSpielberg directed the science fiction Ready Player One (2018), adapted from the novel of the same name by Ernest Cline. It stars Tye Sheridan, Olivia Cooke, Ben Mendelsohn, Lena Waithe, T.J. Miller, Simon Pegg, and Mark Rylance. The plot takes place in 2045 when much of humanity uses virtual reality to escape the real world. Ready Player One began production in July 2016, and was intended to be released on December 15, 2017, but was moved to March 2018 to avoid competition with Star Wars: The Last Jedi. It premiered at the 2018 South by Southwest film festival. Spielberg\\'s direction was praised along with the action scenes and visual effects, but many critics thought the film was too long and overused 1980s nostalgia.In 2019, Spielberg filmed West Side Story, an adaptation of the musical of the same name. It stars Ansel Elgort and Rachel Zegler in her film debut with Ariana DeBose, David Alvarez, Mike Faist and Rita Moreno in supporting roles. Written by Tony Kushner, the film stays true to the 1950s setting. West Side Story was released in December 2021 to positive reviews and received seven Academy Award nominations including Best Picture, and Best Director. Spielberg also received nominations from the Golden Globe Awards, Directors Guild of America, and Critics\\' Choice Movie Awards. The Economist praised the choreography, stating that it \"stunningly melds beauty and violence\". In March 2022, Spielberg revealed that West Side Story would be the last musical he will direct.Spielberg\\'s 2022 film The Fabelmans is a fictionalized account of his own adolescence, which he wrote with Tony Kushner. Gabriel LaBelle plays Sammy Fabelman, a character inspired by Spielberg, while Michelle Williams plays Sammy\\'s mother Mitzi Fabelman, Paul Dano plays Burt Fabelman, his father, Seth Rogen plays Bennie Loewy, Burt\\'s best friend and co-worker who becomes Sammy\\'s surrogate uncle, and Judd Hirsch as Mitzi\\'s Uncle Boris. Filming began in Los Angeles in July 2021, and the film premiered at the 2022 Toronto International Film Festival on September 10, Spielberg\\'s first appearance at that festival. It received widespread critical acclaim and won the festival\\'s People\\'s Choice Award. It received a limited theatrical release on November 11, 2022, by Universal Pictures, before expanding wide on November 23. Despite the favorable critical reception, West Side Story and The Fabelmans were box office failures, which Variety suggested could be attributed to a decline in the popularity of Spielberg in a film-going environment altered by the COVID-19 pandemic, and the public\\'s loss of interest in prestige films. The Fabelmans received seven Academy Award nominations, including Best Picture, Best Director, and Best Original Screenplay. It was, however, a major box office success in France and became the highest-rated film of the 21st century in the country, with a 4.9 average from critics on AlloCiné from 43 reviews, with all but 6 giving the film 5 stars. Cahiers du Cinéma wrote that Spielberg, at age 76, had \"come to represent like no other, the idea of cinema as wonder, at a time when the relationship to the spectacular and the cinema seems more tormented than ever\" and declared that the film will \"undoubtedly remain the most important and singular film of his career.\"Spielberg had planned to direct Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny, but he stepped down and was replaced by James Mangold. Spielberg said that he would remain \"hands on\" as a producer, along with Kathleen Kennedu and Frank Marshall. In 2016, it was announced that it would be written by David Koepp, with a release by Disney on July 19, 2019. After a change of filming and release dates, it was postponed again when Jonathan Kasdan was announced as the film\\'s new writer. Soon after, a new release date of July 9, 2021, was announced. In May 2019, Dan Fogelman was hired to write a new script, and Kasdan\\'s story, focused on the Nazi gold train, would not be used; the script was ultimately credited to Mangold, Koepp, Jez Butterworth, and John-Henry Butterworth. In April 2020, it was announced that the release of the film was delayed to July 29, 2022, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and in October 2021, the release date was again delayed to June 30, 2023. The film began production in the UK in June 2021 and finished in February 2022.In January 2013, HBO confirmed that it was developing a third World War II miniseries based on the book Masters of the Air by Donald L. Miller with Spielberg and Tom Hanks. NME reported in March 2017 that production was under the working title The Mighty Eighth. By 2019, it was confirmed development of the series, now titled Masters of the Air, had moved to Apple TV+. It premiered on January 26, 2024.\\n\\n\\n=== Upcoming projects ===\\nOn January 18, 2023, Spielberg told press at a red carpet event for The Fabelmans that he was executive producing a documentary about John Williams, directed by Laurent Bouzereau with production companies Amblin Television, Imagine Documentaries, and Nedland Media. Other executive producers for the film include Brian Grazer, Ron Howard, Darryl Frank, Justin Falvey, Justin Wilkes, Sara Bernstein, and Meredith Kaulfers. The announcement came days after Williams suggested that he might not retire from film scoring as he had previously announced.In February 2022, Deadline Hollywood reported that Spielberg was developing an original film centered around the character Frank Bullitt, a fictional San Francisco police officer originally portrayed by Steve McQueen in the 1968 film Bullitt. The screenplay is set to be written by Josh Singer, who previously co-wrote The Post for Spielberg. McQueen\\'s son Chad and granddaughter Molly will serve as executive producers. Bradley Cooper was cast as Bullitt in November 2022 and will also serve as producer alongside Spielberg and Kristie Macosko Krieger.On June 21, 2021, it was announced that Amblin Entertainment signed a deal with Netflix to release multiple new feature films for the streaming service. Under the deal, Amblin is expected to produce at least two films a year for Netflix for an unspecified number of years. It is possible that Spielberg may even direct some projects.\\n\\n\\n=== Prospective projects ===\\nIn May 2009, Spielberg bought the rights to the life story of Martin Luther King Jr., with the intention of being involved as both the producer and director. However, the purchase was made from the King estate, led by son Dexter, while the two other surviving children, the Reverend Bernice and Martin III, immediately threatened to sue, not having given their approvals to the project.In 2015, it was announced that Spielberg was attached to direct an adaptation of American photojournalist Lynsey Addario\\'s memoir It\\'s What I Do, with Jennifer Lawrence in the lead role.In April 2018, it was announced that Spielberg would direct a film adaptation of the Blackhawk comic book series. Warner Bros. will distribute the film, with David Koepp writing the script.In March 2013, Spielberg announced that he was developing a miniseries based on the life of Napoleon. In May 2016, it was announced that Cary Fukunaga is in talks to direct the miniseries for HBO, from a script by David Leland based on extensive research materials accumulated by Stanley Kubrick over the years.Spielberg was set to film an adaptation of David Kertzer\\'s The Kidnapping of Edgardo Mortara in early 2017, for release at the end of that year, but production has been postponed. It was first announced in 2014, with Tony Kushner adapting the book for the screen. Mark Rylance, in his fourth collaboration with Spielberg, was announced to star in the role of Pope Pius IX. Spielberg saw more than 2,000 children to play the role of Edgardo Mortara.During a virtual conversation with Indian filmmaker S. S. Rajamouli in February 2023, Spielberg said that he will not rule out the possibility of a sequel to The Fabelmans, but confirmed that there are currently no immediate plans.\\n\\n\\n== Other ventures ==\\n\\n\\n=== Production ===\\n\\nIn 1984, Spielberg, Frank Marshall, and Kathleen Kennedy founded production company Amblin Entertainment. Between 1984 and 1990, Spielberg served as either producer or executive producer on nineteen feature films; these include: The Goonies, The Money Pit, Joe Versus the Volcano, *batteries not included, Back to the Future, Cape Fear, and Who Framed Roger Rabbit. In some films, such as Harry and the Hendersons and Young Sherlock Holmes, the title \"Steven Spielberg Presents\" would be shown in the opening credits. Much of Spielberg\\'s producing work was aimed at children and teens, including cartoons such as Tiny Toon Adventures, Animaniacs, Pinky and the Brain, Freakazoid!, and Family Dog. Spielberg also produced the Don Bluth animations, An American Tail and The Land Before Time.In 1994, Spielberg set up his new film studio, DreamWorks, with Jeffrey Katzenberg and David Geffen. Spielberg cited more creative control and distribution improvements as the main reasons for founding his own studio; he and his partners compared themselves to the founders of United Artists back in 1919. DreamWorks\\' investors included Microsoft founders Paul Allen and Bill Gates. After founding DreamWorks, Spielberg continued to operate Amblin Entertainment and direct films for other studios.\\n\\n\\n=== Video games ===\\nSpielberg has been an avid gamer since 1974; in 2005, Spielberg collaborated with Electronic Arts (EA) on several games including one for the Wii called Boom Blox, and its sequel Boom Blox Bash Party. He is also the creator of EA\\'s Medal of Honor series. In 1995, Spielberg helped create and design LucasArts\\' adventure game The Dig. He also collaborated with software publishers Knowledge Adventure on the game Steven Spielberg\\'s Director\\'s Chair, which was released in 1996; Spielberg appears in the game to direct the player.Spielberg played many of LucasArts adventure games, including the first Monkey Island games. He owns a Wii, a PlayStation 3, a PSP, and an Xbox 360, and enjoys playing first-person shooters such as the Medal of Honor series and Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare. He dislikes the use of cutscenes in games, and thinks that natural storytelling is a challenge for game developers.\\n\\n\\n== Filmmaking style and techniques ==\\n\\n\\n=== Influences ===\\nSpielberg has cited Frank Capra\\'s It\\'s A Wonderful Life (1946) as an influence on \"family, community and suburbia\". He enjoyed the work of Alfred Hitchcock, David Lean, John Ford, Stanley Kubrick and John Frankenheimer. In college, he was inspired by foreign films directed by Ingmar Bergman, Jacques Tati and François Truffaut. Truffaut was one of his favorite directors. Spencer Tracy has also influenced the characters of Spielberg\\'s films, as did The Twilight Zone series.\\n\\n\\n=== Method and themes ===\\nSpielberg often uses storyboards to visualize the sequences, with the exceptions being in E.T. and The Color Purple. After the experience of filming Jaws, Spielberg learned to leave special effect scenes until last, and exclude the media from filming locations. Spielberg prefers to shoot quickly, with large amounts of coverage (from single-shot to multi-shot setups), so that he will have many options in the editing room. From the beginning of his career, Spielberg\\'s shooting style consisted of extreme high and low camera angles, long takes, and handheld cameras. He favors wide-angle lens for creating depth, and by the time he was making Minority Report, he was more confident with elaborate camera movements.\\nIn an interview with The Tech in 2015, Spielberg described how he chooses the film projects he would work on:[Sometimes], a story speaks to me, even if it doesn\\'t speak to any of my collaborators or any of my partners, who look at me and scratch their heads and say, \"Gee, are you sure you wanna get into that trench for a year and a half?\" I love people challenging me that way because it\\'s a real test about my own convictions and [whether] I can be the standing man of my own life and take a stand on a subject that may not be popular, but that I would be proud to add to the body of my work. That\\'s pretty much the litmus test that gets me to say, \"Yeah, I\\'ll direct that one.\"Spielberg\\'s films contain many similar themes throughout his work. One of his most pertinent themes revolves around \"ordinary people in extraordinary circumstances.\" The ordinary people often have limitations, but they succeed in becoming a \"hero\". A consistent theme in his family-friendly work is a childlike sense of wonder and faith, and \"the goodness in humanity will prevail.\" He has also explored the importance of childhood, loss of innocence, and the need for parental figures. In exploring the parent-child relationship, there is usually a flawed or irresponsible father figure. This theme personally resonates with Spielberg\\'s childhood. Exploring extraterrestrial life is another aspect to his work. Spielberg described himself as like an \"alien\" during childhood, and this interest came from his father, a science fiction fan.\\n\\n\\n=== Collaborators ===\\nMichael Kahn has edited all but one of Spielberg\\'s films since the 1970s. Spielberg has also worked consistently with production designer Rick Carter, and writer David Koepp. The producer Kathleen Kennedy is one of Spielberg\\'s longest serving collaborators. Spielberg also displays loyalty to his actors, casting them repeatedly, including Tom Hanks, Harrison Ford, Mark Rylance, Richard Dreyfuss, and Tom Cruise. In 2005, Cruise called him \"the greatest storyteller cinema\\'s ever known\".Hanks has collaborated with Spielberg in various projects in both film and television. He first worked with Spielberg in 1998\\'s Saving Private Ryan, for which he received a nomination for Academy Award for Best Actor. Hanks starred in four more films, Catch Me if You Can (2002), The Terminal (2004), Bridge of Spies (2015), and The Post (2017). The pair also executive produced the war miniseries Band of Brothers (2001) and The Pacific (2010), both of which gained them Primetime Emmy Awards.Janusz Kamiński has served as a cinematographer on dozens of Spielberg\\'s films. Kamiński\\'s first collaboration with Spielberg started with the holocaust drama film Schindler\\'s List (1993) for which Kamiński received the Academy Award for Best Cinematography. The film used black-and-white cinematography. As Spielberg\\'s career evolved from action to drama films, he and Kamiński adopted more handheld camerawork, as evidenced in Schindler\\'s List and Amistad. Kamiński would later receive his second Academy Award for cinematography on Saving Private Ryan. The film\\'s opening sequence to re-enact the invasion of Normandy was praised for realism. Kamiński garnered three more Academy Award nominations for his work on War Horse (2011), the historical epic Lincoln (2015), and West Side Story (2021).Spielberg\\'s long-time partnership with composer John Williams began with The Sugarland Express (1974) Williams would return to compose all but five of Spielberg\\'s feature films (the exceptions are Twilight Zone: The Movie, The Color Purple, Bridge of Spies, Ready Player One and West Side Story). Williams won three of his five Academy Awards for Best Original Score for his work on Spielberg\\'s films, which were Jaws (1975), E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial (1982), and Schindler\\'s List (1993). While making Schindler\\'s List, Spielberg approached Williams about composing the score. After seeing a rough, unedited cut, Williams was impressed, and said that composing would be too challenging. He said to Spielberg, \"You need a better composer than I am for this film.\" Spielberg responded, \"I know. But they\\'re all dead!\" In 2016, Spielberg presented Williams with the 44th AFI Life Achievement Award, the first to be awarded to a composer. Williams scored Spielberg\\'s latest film The Fabelmans (2022), his 29th film collaboration with Spielberg.\\n\\n\\n== Personal life ==\\nSpielberg met actress Amy Irving in 1976 when she auditioned for Close Encounters of the Third Kind. After meeting her, Spielberg told his co-producer Julia Phillips, \"I met a real heartbreaker last night.\" Although she was too young for the role, she and Spielberg began dating and she eventually moved into what she described as his \"bachelor funky\" house. They broke up in 1979. In 1984, they renewed their romance and married in November 1985. Their son, Max, had been born on June 13 of that year. In 1989, the couple divorced; they agreed to live near each other to share custody of their son. Their divorce settlement is one of the most expensive in history.Spielberg met actress Kate Capshaw when he cast her in Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom. They married on October 12, 1991; Capshaw converted to Judaism before their marriage. Spielberg said he rediscovered \"the honor of being a Jew\" when they married. He said, \"Kate is Protestant and she insisted on converting to Judaism. She spent a year studying, did the \"mikveh\", the whole thing. She chose to do a full conversion before we were married in 1991, and she married me after becoming a Jew. I think that, more than anything else, brought me back to Judaism.\" He credits her for the family\\'s level of observance; \"This shiksa goddess has made me a better Jew than my own parents\", he said. He and his family live in Pacific Palisades, California, and East Hampton, New York.He has five children with Capshaw: Sasha Rebecca Spielberg (born May 14, 1990), Sawyer Avery Spielberg (born March 10, 1992), and Destry Allyn Spielberg (born December 1, 1996), and two adopted children: Theo Spielberg (born August 21, 1988), and Mikaela George (born February 28, 1996). He also has a stepdaughter, Jessica Capshaw (born August 9, 1976).\\nIn 1997, a man named Jonathan Norman stalked and attempted to enter Spielberg\\'s home; Norman was jailed for 25 years. In 2001, Spielberg was stalked by conspiracy theorist and former social worker Diana Napolis. She accused him, and actress Jennifer Love Hewitt, of installing a mind-control device in her brain, and being part of a satanic cult. Napolis was committed to a mental institution, and pled guilty to stalking. She was released on probation with a condition that she have no contact with either Spielberg or Hewitt.Spielberg was diagnosed with dyslexia at age 60.In 2013, Spielberg purchased the 282-foot (86 m) mega-yacht The Seven Seas for US$182 million. He has put it up for sale and has made it available for charter. At US$1.2 million per month, it is one of the most expensive charters on the market. He has ordered a new 300-foot (91 m) yacht at a reported US$250 million.In 2022, at age 75, Spielberg was diagnosed with COVID-19 but recovered.In December 2022, Spielberg was a guest on Desert Island Discs for BBC Radio 4, choosing for his luxury item an H-8 Bolex Camera.\\n\\n\\n== Political views ==\\nSpielberg has usually supported U.S. Democratic Party candidates. He has donated over $800,000 to the Democratic party and its nominees. He has been a close friend of former president Bill Clinton and worked with the president for the USA Millennium celebrations. He directed an 18-minute film for the project, scored by John Williams and entitled The American Journey. It was shown at America\\'s Millennium Gala on December 31, 1999, in the National Mall at the Reflecting Pool at the base of the Lincoln Memorial in Washington, D.C. Spielberg endorsed Hillary Clinton in the 2016 presidential election; he donated $1 million to Priorities USA Action.\\n Spielberg resigned as a member of the national advisory board of the Boy Scouts of America in 2001 because he disagreed with the organization\\'s anti-homosexuality stance. In 2007, the Arab League voted to boycott Spielberg\\'s movies after he donated $1 million for relief efforts in Israel during the 2006 Lebanon War. On February 20, 2007, Spielberg, Jeffrey Katzenberg, and David Geffen invited Democrats to a fundraiser for Barack Obama.In February 2008, Spielberg resigned as advisor to the 2008 Summer Olympics in response to the Chinese government\\'s inaction over the War in Darfur. Spielberg said in a statement, \"I find that my conscience will not allow me to continue business as usual [...] Sudan\\'s government bears the bulk of the responsibility for these on-going crimes, but the international community, and particularly China, should be doing more.\" The International Olympic Committee (IOC) respected Spielberg\\'s decision but IOC president Jacques Rogge expressed disappointment: \"[Spielberg] certainly would have brought a lot to the opening ceremony in terms of creativity.\" Chinese state media called Spielberg\\'s comments \"unfair\".In September 2008, Spielberg and his wife offered their support to same-sex marriage in California by issuing a statement following their donation of $100,000 to the \"No on Proposition 8\" campaign fund, a figure equal to the amount of money Brad Pitt donated to the same campaign less than a week prior. In 2018, Spielberg and his wife donated $500,000 to the March for Our Lives student demonstration in favor of gun control in the United States.In December 2023, following the Hamas-led attack on Israel, the Shoah Foundation, founded by Spielberg, said that it had gathered over 100 video testimonies of those who experienced the attacks on that day to add them to the collection of \"Holocaust survivor and witness testimony.\" Spielberg stated about the attacks, \"I never imagined I would see such unspeakable barbarity against Jews in my lifetime\" and that the Shoah Foundation project will ensure \"that their stories would be recorded and shared in the effort to preserve history and to work toward a world without antisemitism or hate of any kind.\"\\n\\n\\n== Filmography ==\\n\\nProlific in film since the 1960s, Spielberg has directed 36 feature films, and co-produced many works.\\n\\n\\n== Awards and honors ==\\n\\nSpielberg has won three Academy Awards.

Some of his films were in the top ten highest-grossing films of the 1970s and 1980s, with Jaws, E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial and Jurassic Park all becoming the highest-grossing film ever at the time of their respective releases. In 1996, Life magazine named Spielberg the most influential person of his generation. In 2003, Premiere magazine ranked him first place in the list of 100 Most Powerful People in Movies. In 2005, Empire magazine ranked him number one on a list of the greatest film directors of all time. In 2013, Time magazine listed him as one of the 100 most influential people. According to Forbes\\' magazine of Most Influential Celebrities of 2014, Spielberg was ranked at first place.

J. Abrams, Paul Thomas Anderson, Neill Blomkamp, Roland Emmerich, Peter Jackson, Kal Ng, Robert Rodriguez, John Sayles, Ridley Scott, John Singleton, Kevin Smith, Don Hertzfeldt, Gareth Edwards, and Enrique Gato.In 2004, film critic Tom Shone said of Spielberg, \"If you have to point to any one director of the last twenty-five years [1979–2004] in whose work the medium of film was most fully itself – where we found out what it does best when left to its own devices, it has to be that guy.\" Jess Cagle, former editor of Entertainment Weekly, called Spielberg \"... arguably (well, who would argue?) the greatest filmmaker in history.\" Stephen Rowley, writing for Senses of Cinema, discussed Spielberg\\'s strengths as a filmmaker, saying \"there is a welcome complexity of tone and approach in these later films that defies the lazy stereotypes often bandied about his films\", and that \"Spielberg continues to take risks, with his body of work continuing to grow more impressive and ambitious\", concluding that he has only received \"limited, begrudging recognition\" from critics. In a 1999 \"Millennium Movies\" survey of British film fans run by the Sky Premier channel, Spielberg had seven films in the top 100, which made him the most popular director.Critics of Spielberg have argued that his films are commonly sentimental and moralistic. In Easy Riders, Raging Bulls, Peter Biskind wrote that Spielberg is \"infantilizing the audience, reconstituting the spectator as child, then overwhelming him and her with sound and spectacle, obliterating irony, aesthetic self-consciousness, and critical reflection\". Critic Ray Carney and actor Crispin Glover opined that Spielberg\\'s works lack depth and do not take risks. Filmmaker Jean-Luc Godard opined that Spielberg was partly responsible for the lack of artistic merit in mainstream cinema, and accused Spielberg of using Schindler\\'s List to profit from a tragedy. In defense of Spielberg, critic Roger Ebert said \"Has Godard or any other director living or dead done more than Spielberg, with his Holocaust Project, to honor and preserve the memories of the survivors?\"Seven of his films have been inducted into the National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\": Jaws, Close Encounters of the Third Kind, Raiders of the Lost Ark, E.T., Jurassic Park, Schindler\\'s List, and Saving Private Ryan.\\n\\n\\n== See also ==\\nDirectors with two films rated \"A+\" by CinemaScore\\nSteven Spielberg\\'s unrealized projects\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n\\n\\n=== Sources ===\\nBaxter, John (1996).

Widely regarded as one of the greatest players of all time, Messi has won a record eight Ballon d\\'Or awards, a record six European Golden Shoes, and was named the world\\'s best player for a record eight times by FIFA. Until leaving the club in 2021, he had spent his entire professional career with Barcelona, where he won a club-record 34 trophies, including ten La Liga titles, seven Copa del Rey titles, and the UEFA Champions League four times. With his country, he won the 2021 Copa América and the 2022 FIFA World Cup. A prolific goalscorer and creative playmaker, Messi holds the records for most goals in La Liga (474), most hat-tricks in La Liga (36) and the UEFA Champions League (eight), and most assists in La Liga (192) and the Copa América (17). He also has the most international goals by a South American male (106). Messi has scored over 800 senior career goals for club and country, and has the most goals by a player for a single club (672).\\nMessi relocated to Spain from Argentina aged 13 to join Barcelona, for whom he made his competitive debut aged 17 in October 2004. He established himself as an integral player for the club within the next three years, and in his first uninterrupted season in 2008–09 he helped Barcelona achieve the first treble in Spanish football; that year, aged 22, Messi won his first Ballon d\\'Or. Three successful seasons followed, with Messi winning four consecutive Ballons d\\'Or, making him the first player to win the award four times. During the 2011–12 season, he set the La Liga and European records for most goals scored in a single season, while establishing himself as Barcelona\\'s all-time top scorer. The following two seasons, Messi finished second for the Ballon d\\'Or behind Cristiano Ronaldo (his perceived career rival), before regaining his best form during the 2014–15 campaign, becoming the all-time top scorer in La Liga and leading Barcelona to a historic second treble, after which he was awarded a fifth Ballon d\\'Or in 2015. Messi assumed captaincy of Barcelona in 2018, and won a record sixth Ballon d\\'Or in 2019. Out of contract, he signed for French club Paris Saint-Germain in August 2021, spending two seasons at the club and winning Ligue 1 twice. Messi joined American club Inter Miami in July 2023, winning the Leagues Cup in August of that year.\\nAn Argentine international, Messi is the country\\'s all-time leading goalscorer and also holds the national record for appearances. At youth level, he won the 2005 FIFA World Youth Championship, finishing the tournament with both the Golden Ball and Golden Shoe, and an Olympic gold medal at the 2008 Summer Olympics. His style of play as a diminutive, left-footed dribbler drew comparisons with his compatriot Diego Maradona, who described Messi as his successor. After his senior debut in August 2005, Messi became the youngest Argentine to play and score in a FIFA World Cup (2006), and reached the final of the 2007 Copa América, where he was named young player of the tournament. As the squad\\'s captain from August 2011, he led Argentina to three consecutive finals: the 2014 FIFA World Cup, for which he won the Golden Ball, the 2015 Copa América, winning the Golden Ball, and the 2016 Copa América. After announcing his international retirement in 2016, he reversed his decision and led his country to qualification for the 2018 FIFA World Cup, a third-place finish at the 2019 Copa América, and victory in the 2021 Copa América, while winning the Golden Ball and Golden Boot for the latter. That same year, Messi received a seventh Ballon d\\'Or. In 2022, he led Argentina to win the 2022 FIFA World Cup, where he won a record second Golden Ball, scored seven goals including two in the final, and broke the record for most games played at the World Cup (26), later receiving his record-extending eighth Ballon d\\'Or in 2023.\\nMessi has endorsed sportswear company Adidas since 2006. According to France Football, he was the world\\'s highest-paid footballer for five years out of six between 2009 and 2014, and was ranked the world\\'s highest-paid athlete by Forbes in 2019 and 2022. Messi was among Time\\'s 100 most influential people in the world in 2011, 2012, and 2023. In 2020 and 2023, he was named the Laureus World Sportsman of the Year, with Messi being the first team-sport athlete to win the award. In 2020, Messi was named to the Ballon d\\'Or Dream Team and became the second footballer and second team-sport athlete to surpass $1 billion in career earnings.\\n\\n\\n== Early life ==\\nMessi was born on 24 June 1987 in Rosario, Santa Fe, the third of four children of Jorge Messi, a steel factory manager, and his wife Celia Cuccittini, who worked in a magnet manufacturing workshop. On his father\\'s side, he is of Italian and Spanish descent, the great-grandson of immigrants from the north-central Adriatic Marche region of Italy, and on his mother\\'s side, he has primarily Italian ancestry. Growing up in a tight-knit, football-loving family, \"Leo\" developed a passion for the sport from an early age, playing constantly with his older brothers, Rodrigo and Matías, and his cousins, Maximiliano and Emanuel Biancucchi, both of whom became professional footballers. At the age of four he joined local club Grandoli, where he was coached by his father, though his earliest influence as a player came from his maternal grandmother, Celia, who accompanied him to training and matches. He was greatly affected by her death, shortly before his eleventh birthday; since then, as a devout Roman Catholic, he has celebrated his goals by looking up and pointing to the sky in tribute to his grandmother.\\n\\nA lifelong supporter of Newell\\'s Old Boys, Messi joined the Rosario club when he was six years old. During the six years he played for Newell\\'s, he scored almost 500 goals as a member of \"The Machine of \\'87\", the near-unbeatable youth side named for the year of their birth, and regularly entertained crowds by performing ball tricks during half-time of the first team\\'s home games. However, his future as a professional player was threatened when, aged 10, he was diagnosed with a growth hormone deficiency. As his father\\'s health insurance covered only two years of growth hormone treatment, which cost at least $1,000 per month, Newell\\'s agreed to contribute, but later reneged on their promise. He was scouted by Buenos Aires club River Plate, whose playmaker Pablo Aimar he idolised. It was speculated that he failed to be signed into River Plate due to his ill health, however in a 2019 interview, Messi revealed that the club had offered to pay for his medical treatment despite ultimately rejecting him. His goalscoring idol growing up was Brazilian striker Ronaldo, with Messi calling him \"the best forward I\\'ve ever seen\".\\nAs the Messi family had relatives in Catalonia, they sought to arrange a trial with Barcelona in September 2000. First team director Charly Rexach immediately wanted to sign him, but the board of directors hesitated; at the time it was highly unusual for European clubs to sign foreign players of such a young age. On 14 December, an ultimatum was issued for Barcelona to prove their commitment, and Rexach, with no other paper at hand, offered a contract on a paper napkin. In February 2001, the family relocated to Barcelona, where they moved into an apartment near the club\\'s stadium, Camp Nou. During his first year in Spain, Messi rarely played with the Infantiles due to a transfer conflict with Newell\\'s; as a foreigner, he could only be fielded in friendlies and the Catalan league. Without football, he struggled to integrate into the team; already reserved by nature, he was so quiet that his teammates initially believed he was mute. At home, he suffered from homesickness after his mother moved back to Rosario with his brothers and little sister, María Sol, while he stayed in Barcelona with his father.After a year at Barcelona\\'s youth academy, La Masia, Messi was finally enrolled in the Royal Spanish Football Federation (RFEF) in February 2002. Now playing in all competitions, he befriended his teammates, among whom were Cesc Fàbregas and Gerard Piqué. After completing his growth hormone treatment aged 14, Messi became an integral part of the \"Baby Dream Team\", Barcelona\\'s greatest-ever youth side. During his first full season (2002–03), he was top scorer with 36 goals in 30 games for the Cadetes A, who won an unprecedented treble of the league and both the Spanish and Catalan cups. The Copa Catalunya final, a 4–1 victory over Espanyol, became known in club lore as the partido de la máscara, the final of the mask. A week after suffering a broken cheekbone during a league match, Messi was allowed to start the game on the condition that he wear a plastic protector; soon hindered by the mask, he took it off and scored two goals in 10 minutes before his substitution. At the close of the season, he received an offer to join Arsenal, his first from a foreign club, but while Fàbregas and Piqué soon left for England, he chose to remain in Barcelona.\\n\\n\\n== Club career ==\\n\\n\\n=== Barcelona ===\\n\\n\\n==== 2003–2005: rise to the first team ====\\n\\nDuring the 2003–04 season Messi rapidly progressed through the club\\'s ranks, debuting for four youth teams in a single campaign. After being named player of the tournament in four international pre-season competitions with the Juveniles B, he was soon promoted to the Juveniles A, where he scored 18 goals in 11 league games. Messi was then one of several youth players called up to strengthen Frank Rijkaard\\'s depleted first team during the international break. French winger Ludovic Giuly notes that Messi stood out in first team training sessions: \"He destroyed us all... Even the team\\'s starting centre-backs were nervous. He was an alien.\"Messi made his first team debut as a 75th-minute substitute during a friendly against Porto on 16 November 2003. His performance, creating two chances and a shot on goal, impressed the technical staff, and he subsequently began training daily with the club\\'s reserve side, Barcelona B, as well as weekly with the first team. Barcelona\\'s new star player, Ronaldinho, believed the 16-year-old would become an even better player than himself; he soon befriended Messi, whom he called \"little brother\", and eased his transition into the first team.\\nTo gain further match experience, Messi played for Barcelona C, helping to save them from the relegation zone of the Tercera División by scoring five goals in ten games. He signed his first professional contract, which lasted until 2012 and contained an initial buyout clause of €30 million, on 4 February 2004; this automatically increased to €80 million when he made his debut for Barcelona B on 6 March. He played five games with the B team that season but did not score. Physically weaker than his opponents, who were often much older and taller, he worked on increasing his strength in order to be able to shake off defenders. He finished the campaign with a total of 36 goals in all official competitions.During the 2004–05 season, Messi was a guaranteed starter for the B team, playing 17 games and scoring on six occasions. He was not called up to the first team until the senior players asked manager Frank Rijkaard to promote him in October 2004. Since Ronaldinho already played on the left wing, Rijkaard moved the initially-unwilling Messi onto the right, allowing him to cut into the centre of the pitch and shoot with his dominant left foot. He made his league debut as a late substitute against Espanyol on 16 October. At 17 years, three months, and 22 days old, he was at the time the youngest player to represent Barcelona in an official competition. As a substitute, he played 244 minutes in nine matches for the first team that season, including his debut in the Champions League against Shakhtar Donetsk. He scored his first senior goal on 1 May 2005 against Albacete, becoming – at that time – the youngest-ever scorer for the club. That season, Barcelona won the league for the first time in six years.\\n\\n\\n==== 2005–2008: becoming a starting eleven player ====\\n\\nOn his 18th birthday, Messi signed his first senior contract, which increased his buyout clause to €150 million and tied him to the club until 2010. On 24 August, during the Joan Gamper Trophy, he started for the first time and gave a well-received performance against Fabio Capello\\'s Juventus, receiving an ovation from the Camp Nou. Capello sought to take Messi to Juventus on loan, but Inter Milan offered to pay his €150 million buyout clause and triple his wages. Messi seriously considered the offer but ultimately decided to stay. On 16 September, his contract was extended to 2014.\\nDue to issues regarding his legal status, Messi missed the start of the 2005–06 La Liga, but on 26 September, he acquired Spanish citizenship and became eligible to play. Wearing the number 19 shirt, he gradually established himself as the first-choice right winger, forming an attacking trio with Ronaldinho and striker Samuel Eto\\'o; he was in the starting line-up in major matches such as his first Clásico against rivals Real Madrid on 19 November. Messi scored eight goals in twenty-five games, including, against Panathinaikos, his first in the Champions League, but suffered a torn hamstring against Chelsea on 7 March 2006. His participation in the Champions League final was ruled out on the day, and he was so disappointed that he refused to celebrate his team\\'s victory over Arsenal in Paris.While Barcelona began a gradual decline, the 19-year-old Messi established himself as one of the best players in the world during the 2006–07 campaign. Already an idol to the club\\'s supporters, he scored 17 goals in 36 games across all competitions. However, he sustained a metatarsal fracture on 12 November and was injured for three months. He recovered in time for the Champions League last 16 round against Liverpool, but Barcelona lost and were knocked out. In the league, 11 of his 14 goals came from his last 13 games; on 10 March 2007, he became the first player in twelve years to score a hat-trick in a Clásico, which ended in a 3–3 draw. His growing importance to the club was reflected that month in a new contract which greatly increased his wages.\\nAlready frequently compared to compatriot Diego Maradona, Messi nearly replicated Maradona\\'s two most famous goals in the span of seven weeks. During a Copa del Rey semi-final against Getafe on 18 April, he scored a goal remarkably similar to Maradona\\'s Goal of the Century, by collecting the ball near the halfway line, running 60 metres (66 yd), and beating five defenders before scoring with an angled finish, just as Maradona had done; against Espanyol on 9 June, he scored with his hand in similar fashion to Maradona\\'s Hand of God goal. Barcelona faltered that season, failing to reach the Copa del Rey final and losing the league to Real Madrid.After Ronaldinho lost form, Messi became Barça\\'s new star player at only 20 years old, receiving the nickname \"Messiah\" from the Spanish media. He was voted the third-best player of the year in the 2007 Ballon d\\'Or, behind Kaká and runner-up Cristiano Ronaldo, while international managers and national team captains voted him second for the FIFA World Player of the Year award, again behind Kaká. Although he managed to score 16 goals during the 2007–08 campaign, the second half of his season was again marred by injuries after he suffered a torn hamstring on 15 December. Returning against Celtic in the Champions League last 16 round, he reinjured himself during the return leg, which Rijkaard had selected him for against the medical staff\\'s wishes; captain Carles Puyol criticised the Spanish media for pressuring Messi to play every match. Barcelona finished the season without trophies, eliminated in the Champions League by Manchester United, and placed third in the league.\\n\\n\\n==== 2008–10: first treble and Ballon d\\'Or ====\\nAfter two unsuccessful seasons, Rijkaard and Ronaldinho departed from Barclona. In the latter\\'s wake, Messi was given the number 10 shirt, and signed a new contract with an annual salary of €7.8 million, becoming the club\\'s highest-paid player. He and the club implemented strategies to combat his frequent muscular injuries, which ensured he would remain virtually injury-free during the next four years. His performances in 2008 saw him again voted runner-up for the Ballon d\\'Or and the FIFA World Player of the Year award, both times behind Cristiano Ronaldo.\\nIn his first uninterrupted campaign, the 2008–09 season, he scored 38 goals in 51 games. Under Barcelona\\'s new manager Pep Guardiola, Messi played mainly on the right wing as a false winger with the freedom to cut inside. During the Clásico on 2 May 2009, he played for the first time as a false nine, positioned as a centre-forward but dropping deep into midfield to link up with Xavi and Andrés Iniesta. He set up his side\\'s first goal and scored twice to end the match in an emphatic 6–2 victory, the team\\'s greatest-ever score at Real Madrid\\'s Santiago Bernabéu Stadium. He then scored once and assisted a second goal as Barcelona defeated Athletic Bilbao 4–1 to win the Copa del Rey. With 23 league goals from Messi, Barcelona became La Liga champions. The season\\'s Champions League top scorer with nine goals, the youngest in the tournament\\'s history, Messi returned as a false nine for the final on 27 May against Manchester United, in which he scored once; Barcelona won 2–0 and achieved the first treble by a Spanish team. On 18 September, he signed a new contract which increased his salary to €12 million and committed Messi to the club through 2016 with a buyout clause of €250 million.In the second half of 2009, Barcelona became the first club to achieve the sextuple, winning six top-tier trophies in a single year; after winning the Supercopa de España and UEFA Super Cup in August, Messi scored the winning goal to claim the FIFA Club World Cup on 19 December. At 22 years old, Messi won both the Ballon d\\'Or and the FIFA World Player of the Year award by the biggest voting margin in each trophy\\'s history. Unsatisfied with his position on the right wing – with Zlatan Ibrahimović now occupying the central forward role – Messi resumed playing as a false nine in early 2010. He soon effectively became the tactical focal point of Guardiola\\'s team, and his goalscoring rate increased.\\n\\nMessi scored a total of 47 goals in all competitions that season, equalling Ronaldo\\'s club record from the 1996–97 campaign. He became Barcelona\\'s all-time Champions League top scorer by scoring all four of his side\\'s goals in the quarter-final against Arsenal on 6 April. Although Barcelona were eliminated in the Champions League semi-finals by Inter Milan, Messi\\'s eight goals meant he was the competition\\'s top scorer for a consecutive year. As the league\\'s top scorer with 34 goals (again tying Ronaldo\\'s record), he helped Barcelona win a second consecutive La Liga trophy with only a single defeat and earned his first European Golden Shoe.\\n\\n\\n==== 2010–2012: trophies and records ====\\nMessi secured Barcelona\\'s first trophy of the 2010–11 campaign, the Supercopa de España, by scoring a hat-trick in his side\\'s second-leg 4–0 victory over Sevilla. He was again instrumental in a Clásico on 29 November 2010 as Barcelona defeated their rivals 5–0. Messi helped the team achieve 16 consecutive league victories, a record in Spanish football, concluding with another hat-trick against Atlético Madrid on 5 February 2011. His club performances in 2010 earned him the inaugural FIFA Ballon d\\'Or, though his win was met with some criticism due to his lack of success with Argentina at the 2010 FIFA World Cup. Towards the end of the season, Messi played a prominent role in the Champions League semi-final victory against Real Madrid, scoring two goals, the second of which was highly acclaimed, in the first leg. Messi gave a man-of-the-match performance in the Champions League final against Manchester United on 28 May, scoring the match-winning goal of Barça\\'s 3–1 victory, and becoming the competition\\'s top scorer for the third consecutive year. Barcelona won a third consecutive La Liga title, with Messi scoring 31 and assisting 18 goals. He finished the season with 53 goals in all competitions, the highest in Spanish football history.\\nAs Messi developed into a combination of a creator and scorer, he scored an unprecedented 73 goals and provided 29 assists in all club competitions during the 2011–12 season, producing a hat-trick or more on 10 occasions. He began the campaign by helping Barcelona win both the Spanish and European Super Cups, the first with a hat-trick. At the close of the year, on 18 December, he scored twice in the FIFA Club World Cup final, a 4–0 victory over Santos. He again received the FIFA Ballon d\\'Or, becoming only the fourth player in history to win the Ballon d\\'Or three times. Additionally, he won the inaugural UEFA Best Player in Europe Award, a revival of the old-style Ballon d\\'Or. Messi was already widely considered one of the best footballers in history, alongside players like Diego Maradona and Pelé.\\nOn 7 March 2012, Messi scored five times in a Champions League last 16-round match against Bayer Leverkusen, an unprecedented achievement in the UEFA Champions League era. Two weeks later, on 20 March, Messi became the top goalscorer in Barcelona\\'s history at 24 years old, overtaking the 57-year record of César Rodríguez\\'s 232 goals with a hat-trick against Granada. Barcelona\\'s era of greatness under Guardiola was however drawing to an end. Although Guardiola\\'s Barcelona won their 14th trophy in the Copa del Rey against Athletic Bilbao, the team lost the league to Real Madrid and was eliminated in the Champions League semi-finals by Chelsea, with Messi missing a crucial penalty. In Barcelona\\'s last home league match on 5 May, Messi scored all four goals before embracing Guardiola, who had announced his resignation as manager. He finished the season as league top scorer in Europe again, with a La Liga record of 50 goals, while his 73 goals in all competitions made him the single-season top scorer in European history.Under manager Tito Vilanova who had first coached him at La Masia, Messi became Barcelona\\'s all-time top scorer in La Liga with 191 goals, and broke the record of most goals scored in a calendar year, previously set by Gerd Müller in 1972. At the close of the year, Messi had scored a record 91 goals in all competitions for Barcelona and Argentina. Messi again won the FIFA Ballon d\\'Or, becoming the only player in history to win the Ballon d\\'Or four times.Barcelona had virtually secured their La Liga title by the start of 2013. However, their performances deteriorated in the second half of the 2012–13 campaign, with Vilanova absent due to ill health. They were nearly eliminated in the Champions League first knockout round by AC Milan, but two goals and an assist from Messi secured a second-leg comeback. Messi signed a new contract on 7 February, committing himself to the club through 2018 with annual wages of €13 million. He wore the captain\\'s armband for the first time on 17 March, in a league match against Rayo Vallecano; the team\\'s tactical focal point, more than 40% of Barcelona goals that season involved him, up from 24% three years earlier.\\n\\n\\n==== 2013–2014: Messidependencia ====\\n\\nAfter four largely injury-free seasons, the muscular injuries that had previously plagued Messi reoccurred. After he suffered a hamstring strain on 2 April, during the first quarter-final against Paris Saint-Germain (PSG), his appearances became sporadic. In the second leg against PSG, with an underperforming Barcelona down a goal, Messi came off the bench in the second half and within nine minutes helped create their game-tying goal, which allowed them to progress to the semi-finals. Still unfit, he proved ineffective during the first leg against Bayern Munich and was unable to play at all during the second, as Barcelona were defeated 7–0 on aggregate by the eventual champions. These matches gave credence to the notion of Messidependencia, Barcelona\\'s perceived tactical and psychological dependence on their star player.\\nMessi continued to struggle with injury throughout 2013, eventually parting ways with his long-time personal physiotherapist. Further damage to his hamstring sustained on 12 May ended his goalscoring streak of 21 consecutive league games, a worldwide record; he had netted 33 goals during his run, including a four-goal display against Osasuna, while becoming the first player to score consecutively against all 19 opposition teams in La Liga. With 60 goals in all competitions, including 46 goals in La Liga, he finished the campaign as league top scorer in Spain and Europe for the second consecutive year, becoming the first player in history to win the European Golden Shoe three times. Following an irregular start to the new season under manager Gerardo Martino, formerly of his boyhood club Newell\\'s Old Boys, Messi suffered his fifth injury of 2013 when he tore his hamstring on 10 November, leaving him sidelined for two months. Despite his injuries, he was voted runner-up for the FIFA Ballon d\\'Or, relinquishing the award after a four-year monopoly to Cristiano Ronaldo.During the second half of the 2013–14 season, doubts persisted over Messi\\'s form, leading to a perception among the culés that he was reserving himself for the 2014 FIFA World Cup. Statistically, his contribution of goals, shots, and passes had dropped significantly compared to previous seasons. He still managed to break two longstanding records in a span of seven days: a hat-trick on 16 March against Osasuna saw him overtake Paulino Alcántara\\'s 369 goals to become Barcelona\\'s top goalscorer in all competitions including friendlies, while another hat-trick against Real Madrid on 23 March made him the all-time top scorer in El Clásico, ahead of the 18 goals scored by former Real Madrid player Alfredo Di Stéfano. Messi finished the campaign with his worst output in five seasons, though he still managed to score 41 goals in all competitions. For the first time in five years, Barcelona ended the season without a major trophy; they were defeated in the Copa del Rey final by Real Madrid and lost the league in the last game to Atlético Madrid, causing Messi to be booed by sections of fans at the Camp Nou. After prolonged speculation over his future with the club, Messi signed a new contract on 19 May 2014, only a year after his last contractual update; his salary increased to €20 million, or €36 million before taxes, the highest wage in the sport. It was reported that Vilanova played a key role in convincing Messi to stay amid strong interest from José Mourinho\\'s Chelsea.\\n\\n\\n==== 2014–15: second treble ====\\nUnder new manager and former captain Luis Enrique, Messi experienced a largely injury-free start to the 2014–15 season, allowing him to break three more longstanding records towards the end of the year. A hat-trick scored against Sevilla on 22 November made him the all-time top scorer in La Liga, as he surpassed the 59-year record of 251 league goals held by Telmo Zarra. A third hat-trick, scored against city rivals Espanyol on 7 December, allowed him to surpass César Rodríguez as the all-time top scorer in the Derbi barceloní with 12 goals. Messi again placed second in the FIFA Ballon d\\'Or behind Cristiano Ronaldo, largely owing to his second-place achievement with Argentina at the World Cup.At the start of 2015, Barcelona were perceived to be headed for another disappointing end to the season, with renewed speculation in the media that Messi was leaving the club. A turning point came on 11 January during a 3–1 victory over Atlético Madrid, the first time Barça\\'s attacking trident of Messi, Luis Suárez and Neymar, dubbed \"MSN\", each scored in a match, marking the beginning of a highly successful run. After five years of playing in the centre of the pitch, Messi had returned to his old position on the right wing late the previous year, by his own suggestion according to Suárez, their striker. From there, he regained his best form, while Suárez and Neymar ended the team\\'s attacking dependency on their star player. With 58 goals from Messi, the trio scored a total of 122 goals in all competitions that season, a record in Spanish football.\\nTowards the end of the campaign, Messi scored in a 1–0 away win over Atlético Madrid on 17 May, securing the La Liga title. Among his 43 league goals that season was a hat-trick scored in 11 minutes against Rayo Vallecano on 8 March, the fastest of his senior career; it was his 32nd hat-trick overall for Barcelona, allowing him to overtake Telmo Zarra with the most hat-tricks in Spanish football. As the season\\'s top assist provider with 18 he surpassed Luís Figo with the most assists in La Liga; he made his record 106th assist in a fixture against Levante on 15 February, in which he also scored a hat-trick. Messi scored twice as Barcelona defeated Athletic Bilbao 3–1 in the Copa del Rey final on 30 May, achieving the sixth double in their history. His opening goal was hailed as one of the greatest in his career; he collected the ball near the halfway line and beat four opposing players, before feinting the goalkeeper to score in a tight space by the near post.In the Champions League, Messi scored twice and set up another in their 3–0 semi-final victory over Bayern Munich, now under the stewardship of Guardiola. His second goal, which came only three minutes after his first, saw him chip the ball over goalkeeper Manuel Neuer after his dribble past Jérôme Boateng had made the defender drop to the ground; it went viral, becoming the year\\'s most tweeted about sporting moment, and was named the best goal of the season by UEFA. Despite a second-leg loss, Barcelona progressed to the final on 6 June in Berlin, where they defeated Juventus 3–1 to win their second treble, becoming the first team in history to do so. Although Messi did not score, he participated in each of his side\\'s goals, particularly the second as he forced a parried save from goalkeeper Gianluigi Buffon from which Suárez scored the match-winning goal on the rebound. In addition to being the top assist provider with six assists, Messi finished the competition as the joint top scorer with ten goals, which earned him the distinction of being the first player ever to achieve the top scoring mark in five Champions League seasons. For his efforts during the season, he received the UEFA Best Player in Europe award for a second time.\\n\\n\\n==== 2015–16: domestic success ====\\nMessi opened the 2015–16 season by scoring twice from free kicks in Barcelona\\'s 5–4 victory (after extra time) over Sevilla in the UEFA Super Cup. On 16 September, he became the youngest player to make 100 appearances in the UEFA Champions League in a 1–1 away draw to Roma. After a knee injury, he returned to the pitch on 21 November, making a substitute appearance in Barcelona\\'s 4–0 away win over rivals Real Madrid in El Clásico. Messi capped off the year by winning the 2015 FIFA Club World Cup final on 20 December, collecting his fifth club trophy of 2015 as Barcelona defeated River Plate 3–0 in Yokohama. On 30 December, Messi scored on his 500th appearance for Barcelona, in a 4–0 home win over Real Betis.On 11 January 2016, Messi won the FIFA Ballon d\\'Or for a record fifth time in his career. On 3 February, he scored a hat-trick in Barcelona\\'s 7–0 win against Valencia in the first leg of the Copa del Rey semi-final at the Camp Nou. In a 6–1 home win against Celta Vigo in the league, Messi assisted Suárez from a penalty kick. Some saw it as \"a touch of genius\", while others criticised it as being disrespectful to the opponent. The Celta players never complained and their coach defended the penalty, stating, \"Barca\\'s forwards are very respectful.\" The penalty routine has been compared to that of Barça icon Johan Cruyff in 1982, who was battling lung cancer, leading many fans to indicate that the penalty was a tribute to him. Cruyff himself was \"very happy\" with the play, insisting \"it was legal and entertaining\".On 17 February, Messi reached his 300th league goal in a 3–1 away win against Sporting de Gijón. A few days later, he scored both goals in Barcelona\\'s 2–0 win against Arsenal at the Emirates Stadium, in the first leg of the 2015–16 UEFA Champions League round of 16, with the second goal being Barcelona\\'s 10,000th in official competitions. On 17 April, Messi ended a five-match scoring drought with his 500th senior career goal for club and country in Barcelona\\'s 2–1 home loss to Valencia. Messi finished the 2015–16 season by setting up both goals in Barcelona\\'s 2–0 extra time win over Sevilla in the 2016 Copa del Rey final, at the Vicente Calderón Stadium, on 22 May 2016, as the club celebrated winning the domestic double for the second consecutive season. In total, Messi scored 41 goals as Barcelona\\'s attacking trio managed a Spanish record of 131 goals throughout the season, breaking the record they had set the previous season.\\n\\n\\n==== 2016–17: fourth Golden Boot ====\\n\\nMessi opened the 2016–17 season by lifting the 2016 Supercopa de España as Barcelona\\'s captain in the absence of the injured Andrés Iniesta; he set-up Munir\\'s goal in a 2–0 away win over Sevilla in the first leg on 14 August, and subsequently scored in a 3–0 win in the return leg on 17 August. Three days later, he scored two goals as Barcelona won 6–2 against Real Betis in the opening game of the 2016–17 La Liga season. On 13 September, Messi scored his first hat-trick of the season in the opening game of the 2016–17 UEFA Champions League campaign against Celtic in a 7–0 victory; this was also Messi\\'s sixth hat-trick in the Champions League, the most by any player. A week later, Messi sustained a groin injury in a 1–1 draw against Atlético Madrid and was ruled out with injury for three weeks. He marked his return with a goal, scoring three minutes after coming off the bench in a 4–0 home win over Deportivo de La Coruña, on 16 October. Three days after this, he netted his thirty-seventh club hat-trick as Barcelona defeated Manchester City 4–0. On 1 November, Messi scored his 54th Champions League group stage goal in Barcelona\\'s 3–1 away loss to Manchester City, surpassing the previous record of 53 goals held by Raúl.\\nMessi finished the year with 51 goals, making him Europe\\'s top scorer, one ahead of Zlatan Ibrahimović. After placing second in the 2016 Ballon d\\'Or, on 9 January 2017 Messi also finished in second place – behind Cristiano Ronaldo once again – in the 2016 Best FIFA Men\\'s Player Award. On 11 January, Messi scored from a free-kick in Barcelona\\'s 3–1 victory against Athletic Bilbao in the second leg of the round of 16 of the Copa del Rey, which enabled Barcelona to advance to the quarter-finals of the competition; with his 26th goal from a free-kick for Barcelona in all competitions, he equalled the club\\'s all-time record, which had previously been set by Ronald Koeman. In his next league match, on 14 January, Messi scored in a 5–0 win against Las Palmas; with this goal, he equalled Raúl\\'s record for the most teams scored against in La Liga (35).On 4 February 2017, Messi scored his 27th free-kick for Barcelona in a 3–0 home win over Athletic Bilbao in the league, overtaking Koeman as the club\\'s all-time top-scorer from free-kicks. On 23 April, Messi scored twice in a 3–2 away win over Real Madrid. His game-winning goal in stoppage time was his 500th for Barcelona. His memorable celebration saw him taking off his Barcelona shirt and holding it up to incensed Real Madrid fans – with his name and number facing the crowd. On 27 May, Messi scored a goal and set up another for Paco Alcácer in the 2017 Copa del Rey final, helping Barcelona to a 3–1 victory over Alavés, and was named Man of the Match. In total, Messi finished the 2016–17 season with 54 goals, while his 37 goals in La Liga saw him claim both the Pichichi and European Golden Boot Awards for the fourth time in his career.\\n\\n\\n==== 2017–18: domestic double and a record fifth Golden Boot ====\\nMessi opened the 2017–18 season by converting a penalty in Barcelona\\'s 1–3 first leg home defeat to Real Madrid in Supercopa de España.

The announcement garnered a significant media response, including from current and former teammates (who supported Messi\\'s statement) and Catalan president Quim Torra. On 26 August, Barcelona\\'s sporting director Ramon Planes iterated the club\\'s desire to \"build a team around the most important player in the world\" and affirmed Messi will only be able to leave should a buyer pay his €700 million buyout clause; a reported early termination option available in Messi\\'s contract (which would have allowed him to leave the club for free) could only be exercised if he had communicated his decision to Barcelona by 31 May 2020, although the player\\'s representatives argued the deadline should be set to 31 August, due to the adjourned 2019–20 season. On 30 August, La Liga issued a statement stating Messi\\'s contract and buyout clause were still active.On 4 September, Jorge Messi, Lionel\\'s father and agent, released a statement in response to La Liga claiming the release clause \"is not valid when the termination of the contract is by the player\\'s unilateral decision from the end of the 2019–20 season\", as stated in Messi\\'s contract with Barcelona; moments later, La Liga issued a response reiterating their statement published on 30 August. Later that evening, Messi announced in an interview with Goal that he would continue at Barcelona for the final year of his contract. In the interview, Messi claimed to have informed Barcelona of his desire to leave multiple times, and club president Josep Maria Bartomeu said Messi could decide at the end of every season if he wanted to stay or leave, only for Bartomeu to refer to the release clause. This left Messi with two options: to stay or go to court against the club, with the player saying \"I would never go to court against the club of my life\".\\n\\n\\n==== 2020–21: final season at Barcelona ====\\nOn 27 September, Messi began the 2020–21 season by scoring a penalty in a 4–0 home win against Villarreal in La Liga.

The club cited financial and structural obstacles posed by La Liga regulations as a reason for Messi\\'s departure. Club president Joan Laporta also blamed the previous board for Messi\\'s exit by saying \"the basis of everything is the calamitous and disastrous situation left by the previous board\", he added by saying \"the expected debt is much higher and we had some sports contracts in place that meant we had no margin on salary\". Three days later, in a tearful press conference held at the Camp Nou, Messi confirmed that he would be leaving Barcelona.\\n\\n\\n=== Paris Saint-Germain ===\\n\\n\\n==== 2021–22: first season adjustments and seventh Ballon d\\'Or ====\\nOn 10 August, Messi joined French club Paris Saint-Germain (PSG).

However, Messi remained on the bench during the entire match and did not play due to a reported injury, which aroused the anger of the fans at the stadium, who chanted \"refund\" (Cantonese: 回水). Messi\\'s personal social media accounts were flooded by comments of unsatisfied fans. Legislative Council Member Kenneth Fok issued a statement condemning the organizer Tatler and Inter Miami, believing that both of them were responsible, when the latter received sky-high remuneration, but made the fans leave disappointed and owed them  an apology. The Government of Hong Kong also expressed extreme disappointment at Messi\\'s absence and stated that it was considering revoking the HK$16 million sponsorship funds. This incident was dubbed \"Messi Messy\" by CNN, and translated as \"Messi\\'s Chaos\" by the Hong Kong media. On 6 February 2024, Messi and his teammates were full of energy when practicing in Japan. Besides passing the ball, Messi was also able to kick the ball into the goal. This left the fans in Hong Kong suspicious that he had not been injured during the aforementioned match. On 8 February 2024, the Chinese Football Association temporarily halted its partnership with the Argentine Football Association over the incident.A friendly match against Vissel Kobe was held on 7 February 2024. Messi started on the bench, but in the 60th minute of the second half, he came on as a substitute. In the 78th minute, a Messi shot but was saved by the opposing goalkeeper.

Selectors for Spain\\'s Under-17 squad began pursuing him in 2003 after Barcelona\\'s director of football, Carles Rexach, alerted the Royal Spanish Football Federation to their young player. Messi declined the offer, having aspired to represent La Albiceleste since childhood. To further prevent Spain from taking him, the Argentine Football Association organised two under-20 friendlies in June 2004, against Paraguay and Uruguay, with the purpose of finalising his status as an Argentina player in FIFA. Five days after his 17th birthday, on 29 June, he made his debut for his country against Paraguay, scoring once and providing two assists in their 8–0 victory. He was subsequently included in the squad for the South American Youth Championship, held in Colombia in February 2005. As he lacked the stamina of his teammates, the result of his former growth hormone deficiency, he was used as a substitute in six of the nine games. After being named man of the match against Venezuela, he scored the winning 2–1 goal in the crucial last match against Brazil, thereby securing their third-place qualification for the FIFA World Youth Championship.Aware of his physical limitations, Messi employed a personal trainer to increase his muscle mass, returning to the squad in an improved condition in time for the World Youth Championship, hosted by the Netherlands in June. After he was left out of the starting line-up in their first match against the United States, a 1–0 defeat, the squad\\'s senior players asked manager Francisco Ferraro to let Messi start, as they considered him their best player. After helping the team defeat Egypt and Germany to progress past the group stage, Messi proved decisive in the knockout phase as he scored their equaliser against Colombia, provided a goal and an assist against title favourites Spain, and scored their opening goal against reigning champions Brazil. Ahead of the final, he was awarded the Golden Ball as the best player of the tournament. He scored two penalties in their 2–1 victory over Nigeria, clinching Argentina\\'s fifth championship and finishing the tournament as top scorer with 6 goals. His performances drew comparisons with compatriot Diego Maradona, who had led Argentina to the title in 1979.\\n\\n\\n=== 2005–2006: senior and World Cup debuts ===\\nIn recognition of his achievements with the under-20 side, senior manager José Pékerman gave Messi his first call-up for a friendly against Hungary on 17 August 2005. Aged 18, Messi made his senior debut for Argentina in the Ferenc Puskás Stadium when he came on in the 63rd minute, only to be sent off after two minutes for a perceived foul against Vilmos Vanczák, who had grabbed his shirt; Messi had struck the defender with his arm while trying to shake him off, which the referee interpreted as an intentional elbowing, a contentious decision. Messi was reportedly found weeping in the dressing room after his sending-off. He returned to the team on 3 September in their World Cup qualifier defeat to Paraguay, which he had declared his \"re-debut\" ahead of the match. Messi started his first game in the next qualifying match against Peru, in which he was able to win a crucial penalty that secured their victory. After the match, Pékerman described him as \"a jewel\". He subsequently made regular appearances for the team ahead of Argentina\\'s participation in the 2006 FIFA World Cup, scoring his first goal in a friendly against Croatia on 1 March 2006. A hamstring injury sustained a week later jeopardised his presence in the World Cup, but he was nevertheless selected for Pékerman\\'s squad and regained fitness in time for the start of the tournament.During the World Cup in Germany, Messi witnessed their opening match victory against the Ivory Coast from the substitutes\\' bench. In the next match, against Serbia and Montenegro, he became the youngest player to represent Argentina at a FIFA World Cup when he came on as a substitute in the 74th minute. He assisted their fourth strike within minutes and scored the final goal in their 6–0 victory, making him the youngest scorer in the tournament and the sixth-youngest goalscorer in the history of the World Cup. As their progression to the knockout phase was secured, several starters were rested during the last group match. Messi consequently started the game against the Netherlands, a 0–0 draw, as they won their group on goal differential. In the round of 16 match against Mexico, played on his 19th birthday, Messi came on in the 84th minute, with the score tied at 1–1. He appeared to score a goal, but it was contentiously ruled offside, with the team needing a late goal in extra time to proceed. He did not play in the quarter-final against Germany, during which Argentina were eliminated 4–2 in a penalty shootout. Back home, Pékerman\\'s decision to leave him on the bench against Germany led to widespread criticism from those who believed Messi could have changed the outcome of the match in Argentina\\'s favour.\\n\\n\\n=== 2007–2008: Copa América final and Olympic gold ===\\nAs Messi evolved into one of the best players in the world, he secured a place in Alfio Basile\\'s starting line-up, as part of a team considered favourites to win the 2007 Copa América, held in Venezuela. He set up the game-winning goal of their 4–1 victory over the United States in the opening match, before winning a penalty that led to the game-tying first strike of their 4–2 win in the next match against Colombia. At the quarter-final stage, where the group winners faced Peru, he scored the second goal of a 4–0 victory that saw them through to the semi-final, during which he chipped the ball over Mexico\\'s goalkeeper to ensure another 3–0 win. In a surprise defeat, Argentina lost the final 3–0 to a Brazil squad that lacked several of the nation\\'s best players. Their unexpected loss was followed by much criticism in Argentina, though Messi was mostly exempt due to his young age and secondary status to star player Juan Román Riquelme. He was named the best young player of the tournament by CONMEBOL.Ahead of the 2008 Summer Olympics, Barcelona legally barred Messi from representing Argentina at the tournament as it coincided with their Champions League qualifying matches. After interference from newly appointed Barcelona manager Pep Guardiola, who had won the tournament in 1992, Messi was permitted to join Sergio Batista\\'s under-23 squad in Beijing. During the first match, he scored the opening goal in their 2–1 victory over the Ivory Coast. Following a 1–0 win in the next group match against Australia, ensuring their quarter-final qualification, Messi was rested during the game against Serbia, while his side won the match to finish first in their group. Against the Netherlands, he again scored the first goal and assisted a second strike to help his team to a 2–1 win in extra time. After a 3–0 semi-final victory over Brazil, Messi assisted the only goal in the final as Argentina defeated Nigeria to claim Olympic gold medals. Along with Riquelme, Messi was singled out by FIFA as the stand-out player from the tournament\\'s best team.\\n\\n\\n=== 2008–2011: collective decline ===\\nFrom late 2008, the national team experienced a three-year period marked by poor performances. Under manager Diego Maradona, who had led Argentina to World Cup victory as a player, the team struggled to qualify for the 2010 World Cup, securing their place in the tournament only after defeating Uruguay 1–0 in their last qualifying match. Maradona was criticised for his strategic decisions, which included playing Messi out of his usual position. In eight qualifying matches under Maradona\\'s stewardship, Messi scored only one goal, netting the opening goal in the first such match, a 4–0 victory over Venezuela. During that game, played on 28 March 2009, he wore Argentina\\'s number 10 shirt for the first time, following the international retirement of Riquelme. Overall, Messi scored four goals in 18 appearances during the qualifying process. Ahead of the tournament, Maradona visited Messi in Barcelona to request his tactical input; Messi then outlined a 4–3–1–2 formation with himself playing behind the two strikers, a playmaking position known as the enganche in Argentine football, which had been his preferred position since childhood.\\nDespite their poor qualifying campaign, Argentina were considered title contenders at the World Cup in South Africa. At the start of the tournament, the new formation proved effective; Messi managed at least four attempts on goal during their opening match but was repeatedly denied by Nigeria\\'s goalkeeper, resulting in a 1–0 win. During the next match, against South Korea, he excelled in his playmaking role, participating in all four goals of his side\\'s 4–1 victory. As their place in the knockout phase was guaranteed, most of the starters were rested during the last group match, but Messi reportedly refused to be benched. He wore the captain\\'s armband for the first time in their 2–0 win against Greece; as the focal point of their play, he helped create their second goal to see Argentina finish as group winners.Argentina were eliminated in the quarter-final against Germany, at the same stage of the tournament and by the same opponent as four years earlier. Their 4–0 loss was their worst margin of defeat at a World Cup since 1974. FIFA subsequently identified Messi as one of the tournament\\'s 10 best players, citing his \"outstanding\" pace and creativity and \"spectacular and efficient\" dribbling, shooting and passing. Back home, however, Messi was the subject of harsher judgement. As the perceived best player in the world, he had been expected to lead an average team to the title, as Maradona arguably did in 1986, but he had failed to replicate his performances at Barcelona with the national team, leading to the accusation that he cared less about his country than his club.Maradona was replaced by Sergio Batista, who had orchestrated Argentina\\'s Olympic victory. Batista publicly stated that he intended to build the team around Messi, employing him as a false nine within a 4–3–3 system, as used to much success by Barcelona. Although Messi scored a record 53 goals during the 2010–11 club season, he had not scored for Argentina in an official match since March 2009. Despite the tactical change, his goal drought continued during the 2011 Copa América, hosted by Argentina. Their first two matches, against Bolivia and Colombia, ended in draws. Media and fans noted that he did not combine well with striker Carlos Tevez, who enjoyed greater popularity among the Argentine public; Messi was consequently booed by his own team\\'s supporters for the first time in his career. During the crucial next match, with Tevez on the bench, he gave a well-received performance, assisting two goals in their 3–0 victory over Costa Rica. After the quarter-final against Uruguay ended in a 1–1 draw following extra time, with Messi having assisted their equaliser, Argentina were eliminated 4–5 in the penalty shootout by the eventual champions.\\n\\n\\n=== 2011–2013: assuming the captaincy ===\\nAfter Argentina\\'s unsuccessful performance in the Copa América, Batista was replaced by Alejandro Sabella. Upon his appointment in August 2011, Sabella awarded the 24-year-old Messi the captaincy of the squad, in accord with then-captain Javier Mascherano. Reserved by nature, Messi went on to lead his squad by example as their best player, while Mascherano continued to fulfil the role of the team\\'s on-field leader and motivator. In a further redesign of the team, Sabella dismissed Tevez and brought in players with whom Messi had won the World Youth Championship and Olympic Games. Now playing in a free role in an improving team, Messi ended his goal drought by scoring during their first World Cup qualifying match against Chile on 7 October, his first official goal for Argentina in two-and-a-half years.Under Sabella, Messi\\'s goalscoring rate drastically increased; where he had scored only 17 goals in 61 matches under his previous managers, he scored 25 times in 32 appearances during the following three years. He netted a total of 12 goals in 9 games for Argentina in 2012, equalling the record held by Gabriel Batistuta for the most goals scored in a calendar year for their country. His first international hat-trick came in a friendly against Switzerland on 29 February 2012, followed by two more hat-tricks over the next year-and-a-half in friendlies against Brazil and Guatemala. Messi then helped the team secure their place in the 2014 World Cup with a 5–2 victory over Paraguay on 10 September 2013 when he scored twice from penalty kicks, taking his international tally to 37 goals to become Argentina\\'s second-highest goalscorer behind Batistuta. Overall, he had scored a total of 10 goals in 14 matches during the qualifying campaign. Concurrently with his bettered performances, his relationship with his compatriots improved, as he gradually began to be perceived more favourably in Argentina.\\n\\n\\n=== 2014–2015: World Cup and Copa América finals ===\\nAhead of the World Cup in Brazil, doubts persisted over Messi\\'s form, as he finished an unsuccessful and injury-plagued season with Barcelona. At the start of the tournament, however, he gave strong performances, being elected man of the match in their first four matches. In his first World Cup match as captain, he led them to a 2–1 victory over Bosnia and Herzegovina; he helped create Sead Kolašinac\\'s own goal and scored their second strike after a dribble past three players, his first World Cup goal since his debut in the tournament eight years earlier. During the second match against Iran, he scored an injury-time goal from 25 yards out to end the game in a 1–0 win, securing their qualification for the knockout phase. He scored twice in the last group match, a 3–2 victory over Nigeria, his second goal coming from a free kick, as they finished first in their group. Messi assisted a late goal in extra time to ensure a 1–0 win against Switzerland in the round of 16, and played in the 1–0 quarter-final win against Belgium as Argentina progressed to the semi-final of the World Cup for the first time since 1990. Following a 0–0 draw in extra time, they eliminated the Netherlands 4–2 in a penalty shootout to reach the final, with Messi scoring his team\\'s first penalty.\\nBilled as Messi versus Germany, the world\\'s best player against the best team, the final was a repeat of the 1990 final featuring Diego Maradona. Within the first half-hour, Messi had started the play that led to a goal, but it was ruled offside. He missed several opportunities to open the scoring throughout the match, in particular at the start of the second half when his breakaway effort went wide of the far post. Substitute Mario Götze finally scored in the 113th minute, followed in the last minute of extra time by a free kick that Messi sent over the net, as Germany won the match 1–0 to claim the World Cup. At the conclusion of the final, Messi was awarded the Golden Ball as the best player of the tournament. In addition to being the joint third-highest goalscorer, with four goals and an assist, he created the most chances, completed the most dribbling runs, made the most deliveries into the penalty area and produced the most throughballs in the competition. However, his selection drew criticism due to his lack of goals in the knockout round; FIFA President Sepp Blatter expressed his surprise, while Maradona suggested that Messi had undeservedly been chosen for marketing purposes.Another final appearance, the third of Messi\\'s senior international career, followed in the 2015 Copa América, held in Chile. Under the stewardship of former Barcelona manager Gerardo Martino, Argentina entered the tournament as title contenders due to their second-place achievement at the World Cup. During the opening match against Paraguay, they were ahead two goals by half-time but lost their lead to end the match in a 2–2 draw; Messi had scored from a penalty kick, netting his only goal in the tournament. Following a 1–0 win against defending champions Uruguay, Messi earned his 100th cap for his country in the final group match, a 1–0 win over Jamaica, becoming only the fifth Argentine to achieve this milestone. In his 100 appearances, he had scored a total of 46 goals for Argentina, 22 of which came in official competitive matches.As Messi evolved from the team\\'s symbolic captain into a genuine leader, he led Argentina to the knockout stage as group winners. In the quarter-final, they created numerous chances, including a rebound header by Messi, but were repeatedly denied by Colombia\\'s goalkeeper, and ultimately ended the match scoreless, leading to a 5–4 penalty shootout in their favour, with Messi netting his team\\'s first spot kick. At the semi-final stage, Messi excelled as a playmaker as he provided three assists and helped create three more goals in his side\\'s 6–1 victory over Paraguay, receiving applause from the initially hostile crowd. Argentina started the final as the odds-on title favourites, but were defeated by Chile 4–1 in a penalty shootout after a 0–0 extra-time draw. Faced with aggression from opposing players, including taking a boot to the midriff, Messi played below his standards, though he was the only Argentine to successfully convert his penalty. At the close of the tournament, he was reportedly selected to receive the Most Valuable Player award but rejected the honour. As Argentina continued a trophy drought that began in 1993, the World Cup and Copa América defeats again brought intense criticism for Messi from Argentine media and fans.\\n\\n\\n=== 2016–2017: third Copa América final, first retirement, and return ===\\nMessi\\'s place in Argentina\\'s Copa América Centenario squad was initially put in jeopardy when he sustained a back injury in a 1–0 friendly win over Honduras in a pre-Copa América warm-up match on 27 May 2016. It was later reported that he had suffered a deep bruise in his lumbar region. He was later left on the bench in Argentina\\'s 2–1 opening win over defending champions Chile on 6 June due to concerns regarding his fitness. Although Messi was declared match-fit for his nation\\'s second group match against Panama on 10 June, Martino left him on the bench once again; he replaced Augusto Fernández in the 61st minute and subsequently scored a hat-trick in 19 minutes, also starting the play which led to Sergio Agüero\\'s goal, as the match ended in a 5–0 victory, sealing Argentina\\'s place in the quarter-finals of the competition; he was elected man of the match for his performance.\\n\\nOn 18 June, in the quarter-final of the Copa América against Venezuela, Messi produced another man of the match performance, assisting two goals and scoring another in a 4–1 victory, which enabled him to equal Gabriel Batistuta\\'s national record of 54 goals in official international matches. This record was broken three days later when Messi scored a free kick in a 4–0 semi-final win against hosts the United States; he also assisted two goals during the match as Argentina sealed a place in the final of the competition for a second consecutive year, and was named man of the match once again.During a repeat of the previous year\\'s final on 26 June, Argentina once again lost to Chile on penalties after a 0–0 deadlock, resulting in Messi\\'s third consecutive defeat in a major tournament final with Argentina, and his fourth overall. After the match, Messi, who had missed his penalty in the shootout, announced his retirement from international football. He stated, \"I tried my hardest. The team has ended for me, a decision made.\" Chile coach Juan Antonio Pizzi said after the match, \"My generation can\\'t compare him to Maradona that\\'s for my generation, because of what Maradona did for Argentine football. But I think the best player ever played today here in the United States.\" Messi finished the tournament as the second highest scorer, behind Eduardo Vargas, with five goals, and was the highest assist provider with four assists, also winning more Man of the Match awards than any other player in the tournament (3); he was named to the team of the tournament for his performances, but missed out on the Golden Ball Award for best player, which went to Alexis Sánchez.Following his announcement, a campaign began in Argentina for Messi to change his mind about retiring. He was greeted by fans with signs like \"Don\\'t go, Leo\" when the team landed in Buenos Aires. President of Argentina Mauricio Macri urged Messi not to quit, stating, \"We are lucky, it is one of life\\'s pleasures, it is a gift from God to have the best player in the world in a footballing country like ours... Lionel Messi is the greatest thing we have in Argentina and we must take care of him.\" Mayor of Buenos Aires Horacio Rodríguez Larreta unveiled a statue of Messi in the capital to convince him to reconsider retirement. The campaign also continued in the streets and avenues of the Argentine capital, with about 50,000 supporters going to the Obelisco de Buenos Aires on 2 July, using the same slogan.\\n\\nJust a week after Messi announced his international retirement, Argentine newspaper La Nación reported that he was reconsidering playing for Argentina at the 2018 FIFA World Cup qualifiers in September. On 12 August, it was confirmed that Messi had reversed his decision to retire from international football, and he was included in the squad for the national team\\'s upcoming 2018 World Cup qualifiers. On 1 September, in his first game back, he scored in a 1–0 home win over Uruguay in a 2018 World Cup qualifier.\\nOn 28 March 2017, Messi was suspended for four international games for insulting an assistant referee in a game against Chile on 23 March 2017. He was also fined CHF 10,000. On 5 May, Messi\\'s four match ban as well as his 10,000 CHF fine was lifted by FIFA after Argentina Football Association appealed against his suspension, which meant he could now play Argentina\\'s remaining World Cup Qualifiers. Argentina\\'s place in the 2018 World Cup was in jeopardy going into their final qualifying match as they were sixth in their group, outside the five possible CONMEBOL World Cup qualifying spots, meaning they risked failing to qualify for the World Cup for the first time since 1970. On 10 October, Messi led his country to World Cup qualification in scoring a hat-trick as Argentina came from behind to defeat Ecuador 3–1 away; Argentina had not defeated Ecuador in Quito since 2001. Messi\\'s three goals saw him become the joint all-time leading scorer in CONMEBOL World Cup qualifiers with 21 goals, alongside Uruguay\\'s Luis Suárez, overtaking the previous record which was held by compatriot Hernán Crespo.\\n\\n\\n=== 2018: World Cup ===\\n\\nFollowing on from their poor qualification campaign, expectations were not high going into the 2018 World Cup, with the team, without an injured Messi, losing 6–1 to Spain in March 2018. Prior to Argentina\\'s opener, there was speculation in the media over whether this would be Messi\\'s final World Cup. In the team\\'s opening group match against Iceland on 16 June, Messi missed a potential match-winning penalty in an eventual 1–1 draw. In Argentina\\'s second game on 21 June, the team lost 3–0 to Croatia in a huge upset. Post-match the Argentina coach Jorge Sampaoli spoke of the lack of quality in the team surrounding Messi, saying \"we quite simply couldn\\'t pass to him to help him generate the situations he is used to. We worked to give him the ball but the opponent also worked hard to prevent him from getting the ball. We lost that battle\". Croatia captain and midfielder Luka Modrić also stated post match, \"Messi is an incredible player but he can\\'t do everything alone.\"\\nIn Argentina\\'s final group match against Nigeria at the Krestovsky Stadium, Saint Petersburg on 26 June, Messi scored the opening goal in an eventual 2–1 victory, becoming the third Argentine after Diego Maradona and Gabriel Batistuta to score in three different World Cups; he also became the first player to score in the World Cup in his teens, twenties, and his thirties. A goal of the tournament contender, Messi received a long pass from midfield and controlled the ball on the run with two touches before striking it across goal into the net with his weaker right foot. He was awarded Man of the Match. Argentina progressed to the second round as group runners-up behind Croatia. In the round of 16 match against eventual champions France on 30 June, Messi set up Gabriel Mercado\\'s and Sergio Agüero\\'s goals in a 3–4 defeat, which saw Argentina eliminated from the World Cup. With his two assists in his team\\'s second round fixture, Messi became the first player to provide an assist in the last four World Cups, and also became the first player to provide two assists in a match for Argentina since Maradona had managed the same feat against South Korea in 1986.Following the tournament, Messi stated that he would not participate in Argentina\\'s friendlies against Guatemala and Colombia in September, and commented that it would be unlikely that he would represent his nation for the remainder of the calendar year. Messi\\'s absence from the national team and his continued failure to win a title with Argentina prompted speculation in the media that Messi might retire from international football once again. In March 2019, however, he was called up to the Argentina squad once again for the team\\'s friendlies against Venezuela and Morocco later that month. A conversation with Lionel Scaloni and his idol Pablo Aimar made Messi reconsider his decision to retire. He made his international return on 22 March, in a 3–1 friendly defeat to Venezuela, in Madrid.\\n\\n\\n=== 2019–2020: Copa América third-place and suspension ===\\nOn 21 May, Messi was included in Scaloni\\'s final 23-man squad for the 2019 Copa América. In Argentina\\'s second group match on 19 June, Messi scored the equalising goal from the penalty spot in a 1–1 draw against Paraguay. After coming under criticism in the media over his performance following Argentina\\'s 2–0 quarter-final victory over Venezuela on 28 June, Messi commented that it had not been his best Copa América, while also criticising the poor quality of the pitches. Following Argentina\\'s 2–0 semi-final defeat to hosts Brazil on 2 July, Messi was critical of the refereeing, and alleged the competition was \"set up\" for Brazil to win.In the third-place match against Chile on 6 July, Messi set-up Agüero\\'s opening goal from a free kick in an eventual 2–1 win, to help Argentina win the bronze medal; however, he was sent off along with Gary Medel in the 37th minute of play, after being involved in an altercation with the Chilean defender. Following the match, Messi refused to collect his medal, and implied in a post-match interview that his comments following the semi-final led to his sending off. Messi later issued an apology for his comments, but was fined $1,500 and was handed a one-match ban by CONMEBOL, which ruled him out of Argentina\\'s next World Cup qualifier. On 2 August, Messi was banned for three months from international football and was fined $50,000 by CONMEBOL for his comments against the referee\\'s decisions; this ban meant he would miss Argentina\\'s friendly matches against Chile, Mexico and Germany in September and October. On 15 November, Messi played in the 2019 Superclásico de las Américas versus Brazil, scoring the winning goal by a rebound of his saved penalty. On 8 October 2020, Messi scored a penalty in a 1–0 victory against Ecuador, giving Argentina a winning start to their 2022 World Cup qualifying campaign.\\n\\n\\n=== 2021–2022: Copa América and World Cup triumphs ===\\n\\nOn 14 June 2021, Messi scored from a free kick in a 1–1 draw against Chile in Argentina\\'s opening group match of the 2021 Copa América in Brazil. On 21 June, Messi played in his 147th match as he equalled Javier Mascherano\\'s record for most appearances for Argentina in a 1–0 win over Paraguay in their third game of the tournament. A week later, he broke the record when he featured in a 4–1 win against Bolivia in his team\\'s final group match, assisting Papu Gómez\\'s opening goal and later scoring two. On 3 July, Messi assisted twice and scored from a free-kick in a 3–0 win over Ecuador in the quarter-finals of the competition. On 6 July, in a 1–1 draw in the semi-finals against Colombia, Messi made his 150th appearance for his country and registered his fifth assist of the tournament, a cut-back for Lautaro Martínez, matching his record of nine goal contributions in a single tournament from five years earlier; he later scored his spot kick in Argentina\\'s eventual 3–2 penalty shoot-out victory to progress to his fifth international final. On 10 July, Argentina defeated hosts and defending champions Brazil 1–0 in the final, giving Messi his first major international title and Argentina\\'s first since 1993, as well as his nation\\'s joint record 15th Copa América overall. Messi was directly involved in nine out of the 12 goals scored by Argentina, scoring four and assisting five; he was named the player of the tournament for his performances, an honour he shared with Neymar. He also finished as top scorer with four goals tied with Colombia\\'s Luis Díaz, with the Golden Boot awarded to Messi as he had more assists.On 9 September, Messi scored a hat-trick in a 3–0 home win over Bolivia in a 2022 World Cup qualifier which also moved him above Pelé as South America\\'s top male international scorer with 79 goals. In the 2022 Finalissima, the third edition of the CONMEBOL–UEFA Cup of Champions, at Wembley on 2 June 2022, Messi assisted twice in a 3–0 victory against Italy and was named player of the match, securing his second trophy for Argentina at the senior level. Messi then followed this on 6 June with all five Argentina goals in a 5–0 victory in a friendly win over Estonia, overtaking Ferenc Puskás among the all-time international men\\'s top scorers.\\nAt the 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar, Messi scored a penalty in Argentina\\'s opening game, a 2–1 defeat to Saudi Arabia, before scoring with a low 20-yard strike in their next match against Mexico in which Argentina won 2–0, also recording an assist on Enzo Fernández\\'s goal. In the last 16 game against Australia, Messi scored the opening goal in Argentina\\'s 2–1 win in what was his 1,000th senior career appearance, and became the most-capped male South American (CONMEBOL member) footballer of all time, surpassing the previous record set by Ecuador\\'s Iván Hurtado, as well as surpassing and equalling several other FIFA World Cup and national team records. In the quarter-final against the Netherlands, Messi assisted Argentina\\'s first goal for Nahuel Molina with a reverse pass and then scored a penalty as the game finished 2–2 after extra time. Argentina won 4–3 in the penalty shootout, with Messi scoring the first penalty. In the semi-final against Croatia, Messi made a record-equalling 25th World Cup finals appearance, drawing level with Germany\\'s Lothar Matthäus, and scored the opening goal with a penalty before he assisted Argentina\\'s third goal scored by Julián Álvarez in a 3–0 win; with his 11th World Cup goal, Messi overtook Batistuta to become Argentina\\'s all-time top-scorer at the World Cup. Argentina advanced to the final against France, with Messi stating that it would be his final World Cup appearance.In the 2022 FIFA World Cup final on 18 December, Messi made his record 26th World Cup match appearance at Lusail Stadium. He scored Argentina\\'s opening goal with a penalty, becoming in the process the first player since the last-16 round was introduced in 1986 to score a goal in every round of a single World Cup edition. After Argentina\\'s eventual two-goal lead was erased by France forward Kylian Mbappé, who scored twice inside two minutes, Messi would score again in extra-time to restore Argentina\\'s lead, before Mbappé again drew France level. Tied 3–3 after extra-time, the match went to a penalty shoot-out. Messi scored Argentina\\'s first goal in the shoot-out, with Argentina eventually winning 4–2, ending the nation\\'s 36-year wait for the trophy. Messi received the Golden Ball for player of the tournament, becoming the first player to win it twice. He finished second in the Golden Boot race with seven goals in seven games, one behind Mbappé. With his appearance and two goals in the final, Messi overtook Matthaüs as the player with most appearances at the World Cup (26), and Pelé as the player with most direct goal contributions at the World Cup (21 – 13 goals and 8 assists). The championship game was widely acclaimed as one of the best of all time, with media coverage heavily framing it as a duel between Messi and Mbappé. Following the game, Messi confirmed that he had no plans to retire from the national team, saying \"I want to continue playing as a champion\". In December 2023, a set of jerseys he had worn during the World Cup was sold at auction for 7.8 million dollars.\\n\\n\\n=== 2023–present: 100 international goals ===\\nIn March 2023, Messi made his return to Argentina as a world champion with two appearances in friendlies in his home country. He scored his 99th international goal with a free-kick in Argentina\\'s 2–0 win over Panama; this also marked his 800th senior career goal for club and country. In the following match against Curaçao, Messi scored a hat-trick, his ninth for Argentina, and recorded an assist in a 7–0 win. The first of his three goals saw him reach 100 international goals, making Messi the third player in history to reach the milestone.\\n\\n\\n== Player profile ==\\n\\n\\n=== Style of play ===\\nDue to his short stature, Messi has a lower centre of gravity than taller players, which gives him greater agility, allowing him to change direction more quickly and evade opposing tackles; this has led the Spanish media to dub him La Pulga Atómica (\"The Atomic Flea\"). Despite being physically unimposing, he possesses significant upper-body strength, which, combined with his low centre of gravity and resulting balance, aids him in withstanding physical challenges from opponents; he has consequently been noted for his lack of diving in a sport rife with playacting. His short, strong legs allow him to excel in short bursts of acceleration while his quick feet enable him to retain control of the ball when dribbling at speed. His former Barcelona manager Pep Guardiola once stated, \"Messi is the only player that runs faster with the ball than he does without it.\" Although he has improved his ability with his weaker foot since his mid-20s, Messi is predominantly a left-footed player; with the outside of his left foot, he usually begins dribbling runs, while he uses the inside of his foot to finish and provide passes and assists.A prolific goalscorer, Messi is known for his finishing, positioning, quick reactions, and ability to make attacking runs to beat the defensive line. He also functions in a playmaking role, courtesy of his vision and range of passing. He has often been described as a magician; a conjurer, creating goals and opportunities where seemingly none exist. Moreover, he is an accurate free kick and penalty kick taker. As of September 2023, Messi ranks 5th all time in goals scored from direct free kicks with 65, the most among active players. He also has a penchant for scoring from chips.\\nMessi\\'s pace and technical ability enable him to undertake individual dribbling runs towards goal, in particular during counterattacks, usually starting from the halfway line or the right side of the pitch. Widely considered to be the best dribbler in the world, and one of the greatest dribblers of all time, with regard to this ability, his former Argentina manager Diego Maradona has said of him, \"The ball stays glued to his foot; I\\'ve seen great players in my career, but I\\'ve never seen anyone with Messi\\'s ball control.\" Beyond his individual qualities, he is also a well-rounded, hard-working team player, known for his creative combinations, in particular with former Barcelona midfielders Xavi and Andrés Iniesta.Tactically, Messi plays in a free attacking role; a versatile player, he is capable of attacking on either wing or through the centre of the pitch. His favoured position in childhood was the playmaker behind two strikers, known as the enganche in Argentine football, but he began his career in Spain as a left-winger or left-sided forward. Upon his first-team debut, he was moved onto the right wing by manager Frank Rijkaard; from this position, he could more easily cut through the defence into the middle of the pitch and curl shots on goal with his left foot, rather than predominantly cross balls for teammates. Under Guardiola and subsequent managers, he most often played in a false nine role; positioned as a centre-forward or lone striker, he would roam the centre, often moving deep into midfield and drawing defenders with him, in order to create and exploit spaces for passes, other teammates\\' attacking runs off the ball, Messi\\'s own dribbling runs, or combinations with Xavi and Iniesta. Under the stewardship of Luis Enrique, Messi initially returned to playing in the right-sided position that characterised much of his early career in the manager\\'s 4–3–3 formation, while he was increasingly deployed in a deeper, free playmaking role in later seasons. Under manager Ernesto Valverde, Messi played in a variety of roles. While he occasionally continued to be deployed in a deeper role, from which he could make runs from behind into the box, or even on the right wing or as a false nine, he was also used in a more offensive, central role in a 4–2–3–1, or as a second striker in a 4–4–2 formation, where he was once again given the licence to drop deep, link-up with midfielders, orchestrate his team\\'s attacking plays, and create chances for his attacking partner Suárez.\\nAs his career advanced, and his tendency to dribble diminished slightly with age, Messi began to dictate play in deeper areas of the pitch and developed into one of the best passers and playmakers in football history. His work-rate off the ball and defensive responsibilities also decreased as his career progressed; by covering less ground on the pitch, and instead conserving his energy for short bursts of speed, he was able to improve his efficiency, movement, and positional play, and was also able to avoid muscular injuries, despite often playing a large number of matches throughout a particular season on a consistent basis. Indeed, while he was injury-prone in his early career, he was later able to improve his injury record by running less off the ball, and by adopting a stricter diet, training regime, and sleep schedule. With the Argentina national team, Messi has similarly played anywhere along the frontline; under various managers, he has been employed on the right wing, as a false nine, as an out-and-out striker, in a supporting role alongside another forward, or in a deeper, free creative role as a classic number 10 playmaker or attacking midfielder behind the strikers.\\n\\n\\n=== Reception and comparisons to Diego Maradona ===\\n\\nA prodigious talent as a teenager, Messi established himself among the world\\'s best players before age 20. Diego Maradona considered the 18-year-old Messi the best player in the world alongside Ronaldinho, while the Brazilian himself, shortly after winning the 2005 Ballon d\\'Or, commented, \"I\\'m not even the best at Barça\", in reference to his protégé. Four years later, after Messi had won his first Ballon d\\'Or by a record margin, the public debate regarding his qualities as a player moved beyond his status in contemporary football to the possibility that he was one of the greatest players in history. An early proponent was his then-manager Pep Guardiola, who, as early as August 2009, declared Messi to be the best player he had ever seen. In the following years, this opinion gained greater acceptance among pundits, managers, former and current players, and by the end of Barça\\'s second treble-winning season, the view of Messi as one of the greatest footballers of all time had become the apparent view among many fans and pundits in continental Europe. He initially received several dismissals by critics, based on the fact that he had not won an international trophy at senior level with Argentina, until he won his first at the 2021 Copa América.\\n\\nThroughout his career, Messi has been compared with his late compatriot Diego Maradona, due to their similar playing styles as diminutive, left-footed dribblers. Initially, he was merely one of many young Argentine players, including his boyhood idol Pablo Aimar, to receive the \"New Maradona\" moniker, but as his career progressed, Messi proved his similarity beyond all previous contenders, establishing himself as the greatest player Argentina had produced since Maradona. Jorge Valdano, who won the 1986 World Cup alongside Maradona, said in October 2013, \"Messi is Maradona every day. For the last five years, Messi has been the Maradona of the World Cup in Mexico.\" César Menotti, who as manager orchestrated their 1978 World Cup victory, echoed this sentiment when he opined that Messi plays \"at the level of the best Maradona\". Other notable Argentines in the sport, such as Osvaldo Ardiles, Javier Zanetti, and Diego Simeone, have expressed their belief that Messi has overtaken Maradona as the best player in history.In Argentine society, prior to 2019, Messi was generally held in lesser esteem than Maradona, a consequence of not only his perceived uneven performances with the national team, but also of differences in class, personality, and background. Messi is in some ways the antithesis of his predecessor: where Maradona was an extroverted, controversial character who rose to greatness from the slums, Messi is reserved and unassuming, an unremarkable man outside of football. An enduring mark against him is the fact that, through no fault of his own, he never proved himself in the Argentine Primera División as an upcoming player, achieving stardom overseas from a young age, while his lack of outward passion for the Albiceleste shirt (until 2019 he did not sing the national anthem and is disinclined to emotional displays) have in the past led to the false perception that he felt Catalan rather than truly Argentine. Football journalist Tim Vickery states the view among Argentines is that Messi \"was always seen as more Catalan than one of them\". Despite having lived in Spain since age 13, Messi rejected the option of representing Spain internationally. He has said: \"Argentina is my country, my family, my way of expressing myself. I would change all my records to make the people in my country happy.\" Moreover, several pundits and footballing figures, including Maradona, questioned Messi\\'s leadership with Argentina at times, despite his playing ability. Vickery states the perception of Messi among Argentines changed in 2019, with Messi making a conscious effort to become \"more one of the group, more Argentine\", with Vickery adding that following the World Cup victory in 2022 Messi would now be held in the same esteem by his compatriots as Maradona.\\n\\n\\n=== Comparisons with Cristiano Ronaldo ===\\n\\nAmong his contemporary peers, Messi is most often compared and contrasted with Portuguese forward Cristiano Ronaldo, as part of an ongoing rivalry that has been compared to past sports rivalries like the Muhammad Ali–Joe Frazier rivalry in boxing, the Roger Federer–Rafael Nadal rivalry in tennis, and the Prost–Senna rivalry from Formula One motor racing.Although Messi has at times denied any rivalry, they are widely believed to push one another in their aim to be the best player in the world. Since 2008, Messi has won eight Ballons d\\'Or to Ronaldo\\'s five, seven FIFA World\\'s Best Player awards to Ronaldo\\'s five, and six European Golden Shoes to Ronaldo\\'s four. Pundits and fans regularly argue the individual merits of both players. Beyond their playing styles, the debate also revolves around their differing physiques – Ronaldo is 1.87 m (6 ft 1+1⁄2 in) with a muscular build – and contrasting public personalities with Ronaldo\\'s self-confidence and theatrics a foil to Messi\\'s humility. From 2009–10 to 2017–18, Messi faced Ronaldo at least twice every season in El Clásico, which ranks among the world\\'s most viewed annual sports events. Off the pitch, Ronaldo is his direct competitor in terms of salary, sponsorships, and social media fanbase.After Messi led Argentina to victory in the 2022 FIFA World Cup, a number of football critics, commentators, and players have opined that Messi has settled the debate between the two players.\\n\\n\\n== In popular culture ==\\nMessi was the world\\'s highest-paid footballer for five years out of six between 2009 and 2014; he was the first player to exceed the €40 million benchmark, with earnings of €41 million in 2013, and the €50–€60 million points, with income of €65 million in 2014. Messi was second on Forbes list of the world\\'s highest-paid athletes, after Ronaldo, with income of $81 million from salary and endorsements in 2015–16. In 2018 he was the first player to exceed the €100m benchmark for a calendar year, with earnings of €126m ($154m) in combined income from salaries, bonuses and endorsements. Forbes ranked him the world\\'s highest-paid athlete in 2019. From 2008, he was Barcelona\\'s highest-paid player, receiving a salary that increased incrementally from €7.8 million to €13 million over the next five years. Signing a new contract in 2017, he earned $667,000 per week in wages, and Barcelona paid him $60 million as a signing on bonus. His buyout clause was set at $835 million (€700 million). In 2020, Messi became the second footballer, as well as the second athlete in a team sport, after Ronaldo, to surpass $1 billion in earnings during their careers.\\nIn addition to salary and bonuses, much of his income derives from endorsements; SportsPro has consequently cited him as one of the world\\'s most marketable athletes every year since their research began in 2010. His main sponsor since 2006 is Adidas. As Barcelona\\'s leading youth prospect, he was signed with Nike since age 14, but transferred to Adidas after they successfully challenged their rival\\'s claim to his image rights in court. Messi established himself as their leading brand endorser; from 2008, he had a long-running signature collection of Adidas F50 boots, and in 2015, became the first footballer to receive his own sub-brand of Adidas boots, the Adidas Messi. Since 2017, he has worn the latest version of the Adidas Nemeziz. In 2015, a Barcelona jersey with Messi\\'s name and number was the best-selling replica jersey worldwide. At the 2022 World Cup, Adidas sold out of Messi\\'s Argentina No.10 jersey worldwide.\\nAs a commercial entity, Messi\\'s brand has been based exclusively on his talents and achievements as a player, in contrast to arguably more glamorous players like Ronaldo and David Beckham. At the start of his career, he thus mainly held sponsorship contracts with companies that employ sports-oriented marketing, such as Adidas, Pepsi, and Konami. From 2010, concurrently with increased achievements as a player, his marketing appeal widened, leading to long-term endorsement deals with luxury brands Dolce & Gabbana and Audemars Piguet. Messi is a global brand ambassador for Gillette, Turkish Airlines, Ooredoo, and Tata Motors, among other companies. Messi was the face of Konami\\'s video game series Pro Evolution Soccer, appearing on the covers of PES 2009, PES 2010, PES 2011 and PES 2020. He subsequently signed with rival company EA Sports to become the face of their series FIFA and appeared on consecutive covers from FIFA 13 to FIFA 16.Messi was among the Time 100, an annual list of the world\\'s most influential people, in 2011, 2012 and 2023. His fanbase on Facebook is among the largest of public figures: within seven hours of its launch in April 2011, Messi\\'s Facebook page had nearly seven million followers, and by July 2023 he had over 114 million followers, the second highest for a sportsperson after Cristiano Ronaldo. He has over 450 million Instagram followers, the second highest for an individual and sportsperson after Cristiano Ronaldo. His World Cup celebration post from 18 December 2022 is the most liked post on Instagram with over 70 million likes. According to a 2014 survey in 15 international markets, Messi was familiar to 87% of respondents around the world, of whom 78% perceived him favourably, making him the second-most recognised player globally, behind Ronaldo, and the most likable of all contemporary players. On his economic impact on the city in which he plays, Terry Gibson called him a \"tourist attraction\".\\nMadame Tussauds unveiled their first wax sculpture of Messi at Wembley Stadium in 2012. A gold replica of his left foot, weighing 25 kg (55 lb) and valued at $5.3 million, went on sale in Japan in 2013 to raise funds for victims of the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami. In 2013, a Turkish Airlines advertisement starring Messi, in which he engages in a selfie competition with Kobe Bryant, was the most-watched ad on YouTube in 2013, receiving 137 million views, and was voted the best advertisement of the 2005–15 decade to commemorate YouTube\\'s founding. World Press Photo selected \"The Final Game\", a photo of Messi facing the World Cup trophy after Argentina\\'s final defeat to Germany, as the best sports image of 2014. Messi, a documentary by filmmaker Álex de la Iglesia, premiered at the Venice Film Festival in August 2014.In June 2021, Messi signed a five-year deal to become an ambassador for the Hard Rock Cafe brand. He stated, \"sports and music are an integral part of my life. It is an honor to be the first athlete to partner with a brand who has a history of teaming with music legends.\" In May 2022, Messi was unveiled as Saudi Arabia\\'s tourism ambassador. Due to Saudi Arabia\\'s poor human rights record, Messi was condemned the role which was viewed as an attempt of Saudi sportswashing. In April 2023, Messi was featured in the 200 year old Thrissur Pooram festival in Kerala, India. During Thrissur Pooram, which is one of the largest festivals in Asia, umbrellas carrying the illuminated cut outs of Messi holding the World Cup trophy were displayed on the top of caparisoned elephants during the Kudamattam ceremony.\\n\\n\\n== Personal life ==\\n\\n\\n=== Family and relationships ===\\nSince 2008, Messi has been in a relationship with Antonela Roccuzzo, a fellow native of Rosario. He has known Roccuzzo since he was five years old, as she is the cousin of his childhood best friend, Lucas Scaglia, who is also a football player. After keeping their relationship private for a year, Messi first confirmed their romance in an interview in January 2009, before going public a month later during a carnival in Sitges after the Barcelona–Espanyol derby.\\n\\nMessi and Roccuzzo have three sons. To celebrate his partner\\'s first pregnancy, Messi placed the ball under his shirt after scoring in Argentina\\'s 4–0 win against Ecuador on 2 June 2012, before confirming the pregnancy in an interview two weeks later. Thiago was born in Barcelona on 2 November 2012. In April 2015, Messi confirmed that they were expecting another child. On 30 June 2017, he married Roccuzzo at a luxury hotel named Hotel City Center in Rosario. In October 2017, his wife announced they were expecting their third child. Messi and his family are Catholic Christians.Messi enjoys a close relationship with his immediate family members, particularly his mother, Celia, whose face he has tattooed on his left shoulder. His professional affairs are largely run as a family business: his father, Jorge, has been his agent since he was 14, and his oldest brother, Rodrigo, handles his daily schedule and publicity. His mother and other brother, Matías, manage his charitable organization, the Leo Messi Foundation, and take care of personal and professional matters in Rosario.Since leaving for Spain aged 13, Messi has maintained close ties to his hometown of Rosario, even preserving his distinct Rosarino accent. He has kept ownership of his family\\'s old house, although it has long stood empty; he maintains a penthouse apartment in an exclusive residential building for his mother, as well as a family compound just outside the city. Once when he was in training with the national team in Buenos Aires, he made a three-hour trip by car to Rosario immediately after practice to have dinner with his family, spent the night with them, and returned to Buenos Aires the next day in time for practice. Messi keeps in daily contact via phone and text with a small group of confidants in Rosario, most of whom were fellow members of \"The Machine of \\'87\" at Newell\\'s Old Boys. While at Barcelona he lived in Castelldefels, a village near Barcelona. He was on bad terms with the club after his transfer to Barcelona, but by 2012 their public feud had ended, with Newell\\'s embracing their ties with Messi, even issuing a club membership card to his newborn son. Messi has long planned to return to Rosario to end his playing career at Newell\\'s. Messi holds triple citizenship, as he is a citizen of Argentina, Italy, and Spain.\\n\\n\\n=== Philanthropy ===\\nThroughout his career, Messi has been involved in charitable efforts aimed at vulnerable children, a commitment that stems in part from the medical difficulties he faced in his own childhood. Since 2004, he has contributed his time and finances to the United Nations Children\\'s Fund (UNICEF), an organisation with which Barcelona also have a strong association. Messi has served as a UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador since his appointment in March 2010, completing his first field mission for the organisation four months later as he travelled to Haiti to bring public awareness to the plight of the country\\'s children in the wake of the 2010 Haiti earthquake. He has since participated in UNICEF campaigns targeting HIV prevention, education, and the social inclusion of disabled children. To celebrate his son\\'s first birthday, in November 2013, Messi and Thiago were part of a publicity campaign to raise awareness of mortality rates among disadvantaged children.\\nIn addition to his work with UNICEF, Messi founded his own charitable organisation, the Leo Messi Foundation, which supports access to health care, education, and sport for children. It was established in 2007 following a visit Messi paid to a hospital for terminally ill children in Boston, an experience that resonated with him to the point that he decided to reinvest part of his earnings into society. Through his foundation, Messi has awarded research grants, financed medical training, and invested in the development of medical centres and projects in Argentina, Spain, and elsewhere in the world. In addition to his own fundraising activities, such as his global \"Messi and Friends\" football matches, his foundation receives financial support from various companies to which he has assigned his name in endorsement agreements, with Adidas as their main sponsor.Messi has also invested in youth football in Argentina: he financially supports Sarmiento, a football club based in the Rosario neighbourhood where he was born, committing in 2013 to the refurbishment of their facilities and the installation of all-weather pitches, and funds the management of several youth players at Newell\\'s Old Boys and rival club Rosario Central, as well as at River Plate and Boca Juniors in Buenos Aires. At Newell\\'s Old Boys, his boyhood club, he funded the 2012 construction of a new gymnasium and a dormitory inside the club\\'s stadium for their youth academy. His former youth coach at Newell\\'s, Ernesto Vecchio, is employed by the Leo Messi Foundation as a talent scout for young players. On 7 June 2016, Messi won a libel case against La Razón newspaper and was awarded €65,000 in damages, which he donated to the charity Médecins Sans Frontières. Messi made a donation worth €1 million ($1.1 million) to fight the spread of coronavirus. This was split between Clinic Barcelona hospital in Barcelona, Spain and his native Argentina. In addition to this, Messi along with his fellow FC Barcelona teammates announced he will be taking a 70% cut in salaries during the 2020 coronavirus emergency, and contribute further to the club to provide fully to salaries of all the clubs employees.In November 2016, with the Argentine Football Association being run by a FIFA committee for emergency due to an economic crisis, it was reported that three of the national team\\'s security staff told Messi that they had not received their salaries for six months. He stepped in and paid the salaries of the three members. In February 2021, Messi donated to the Museu Nacional d\\'Art de Catalunya his Adidas shoes which he wore when he scored his 644th goal for Barcelona and broke Pelé\\'s record for most goals scored for a single club; the shoes were later auctioned off in April by the museum for charity to help children with cancer and were sold for £125,000.In advance of the 2021 Copa América in Uruguay, Messi donated three signed shirts to the Chinese pharmaceutical firm Sinovac Biotech—whose directors spoke of their admiration for Messi—in order to secure 50,000 doses of Sinovac\\'s COVID-19 vaccine, CoronaVac, in the hope of vaccinating all of South America\\'s football players. A deal brokered by Uruguay\\'s president Luis Lacalle Pou, the plan to prioritise football players caused some controversy given widespread vaccine scarcity in the region, with the Mayor of Canelones Yamandú Orsi remarking that \"Just as the president manifested cooperation with CONMEBOL to vaccinate for the Copa América, he could just as well have the same consideration for Canelones\".\\n\\n\\n=== Tax fraud ===\\nMessi\\'s financial affairs came under investigation in 2013 for suspected tax evasion. Offshore companies in tax havens Uruguay and Belize were used to evade €4.1 million in taxes related to sponsorship earnings between 2007 and 2009. An unrelated shell company in Panama set up in 2012 was subsequently identified as belonging to the Messis in the Panama Papers data leak. Messi, who pleaded ignorance of the alleged scheme, voluntarily paid arrears of €5.1 million in August 2013. On 6 July 2016, Messi and his father were both found guilty of tax fraud and were handed suspended 21-month prison sentences and respectively ordered to pay €1.7 million and €1.4 million in fines. Facing the judge, he said, \"I just played football. I signed the contracts because I trusted my dad and the lawyers and we had decided that they would take charge of those things.\"\\n\\n\\n== Career statistics ==\\n\\n\\n=== Club ===\\nAs of match played 14 March 2024\\n\\n\\n=== International ===\\n\\nAs of match played 22 November 2023\\n\\n\\n== Honours ==\\n\\nBarcelona\\nLa Liga: 2004–05, 2005–06, 2008–09, 2009–10, 2010–11, 2012–13, 2014–15, 2015–16, 2017–18, 2018–19\\nCopa del Rey: 2008–09, 2011–12, 2014–15, 2015–16, 2016–17, 2017–18, 2020–21\\nSupercopa de España: 2006, 2009, 2010, 2011, 2013, 2016, 2018\\nUEFA Champions League: 2005–06, 2008–09, 2010–11, 2014–15\\nUEFA Super Cup: 2009, 2011, 2015\\nFIFA Club World Cup: 2009, 2011, 2015Paris Saint-Germain\\nLigue 1: 2021–22, 2022–23\\nTrophée des Champions: 2022Inter Miami\\n\\nLeagues Cup: 2023Argentina U20\\n\\nFIFA World Youth Championship: 2005Argentina U23\\n\\nOlympic Gold Medal: 2008Argentina\\n\\nFIFA World Cup: 2022\\nCopa América: 2021\\nCONMEBOL–UEFA Cup of Champions: 2022Individual\\n\\nBallon d\\'Or/FIFA Ballon d\\'Or: 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2015, 2019, 2021, 2023\\nFIFA World Player of the Year: 2009\\nThe Best FIFA Men\\'s Player: 2019, 2022, 2023\\nEuropean Golden Shoe: 2009–10, 2011–12, 2012–13, 2016–17, 2017–18, 2018–19\\nFIFA World Cup Golden Ball: 2014, 2022\\nFIFA World Cup Silver Boot: 2022\\nFIFA Club World Cup Golden Ball: 2009, 2011\\nFIFA U-20 World Cup Golden Ball: 2005\\nFIFA U-20 World Cup Golden Boot: 2005\\nUEFA Club Footballer of the Year: 2008–09\\nUEFA Men\\'s Player of the Year Award: 2010–11, 2014–15\\nUEFA Champions League top scorer: 2008–09, 2009–10, 2010–11, 2011–12, 2014–15, 2018–19\\nCopa América Best Player: 2015, 2021\\nCopa América Top Goalscorer: 2021\\nLa Liga Best Player: 2008–09, 2009–10, 2010–11, 2011–12, 2012–13, 2014–15\\nPichichi Trophy: 2009−10, 2011–12, 2012−13, 2016–17, 2017−18, 2018–19, 2019–20, 2020–21\\nLaureus World Sportsman of the Year: 2020, 2023\\nBallon d\\'Or Dream Team: 2020\\nFIFA FIFPRO World 11: 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023\\nArgentine Sportsperson of the Year: 2011, 2021, 2022, 2023\\nArgentine Footballer of the Year: 2005, 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2015, 2016, 2017, 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023\\n\\n\\n== See also ==\\n\\n\\n== Notes ==\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n\\nBibliography\\n\\n\\n== External links ==\\n\\nOfficial website \\nProfile at Inter Miami\\nProfile at PSG\\nProfile at FC Barcelona\\nProfile at La Liga\\nProfile at Ligue 1\\nProfile at MLS\\nLionel Messi at BDFutbol \\nLionel Messi at Soccerbase \\nLionel Messi at Soccerway \\nLionel Messi at National-Football-Teams.com \\nLionel Messi – FIFA competition record (archived) \\nLionel Messi – UEFA competition record (archive)']\n",
